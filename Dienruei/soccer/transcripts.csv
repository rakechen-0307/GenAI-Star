start,transcript
0:0:0,good evening welcome to the spanish super cup second leg
0:0:15,"It's Barca-Madrid again. I think we've seen this one before, but every time you always expect the best and we've had some great clashes between these two clubs in 2011. I wonder..."
0:0:30,if they really believe they've got the answer to Pep Guardiola's Barcelona we shall get a little bit more of the answer to that question this evening
0:0:45,"Barcelona lining up with the Wembley XI Victor Valdez in goal, a back four of Alves, Abidal, Pique and Busquets A midfield trio of Xabi, Mandanda and Ramos"
0:1:0,"Serrano and Iniesta, Xavi being the captain. Up front it's Pedro, Messi and Bria MVP. Four Real Madrid in goal, Casillas the captain, a back four of Sergio Ramos."
0:1:15,"big Carvalho in Coentrao, big Coentrao comes in for Marcello at left back Barcelona have got Busquets and Pedro starting in place of Keita and Alexis"
0:1:30,"As ever, alongside me in what is literally a sauna of a football stadium, Steve Archibald. Good evening Steve. Good evening Nick."
0:1:45,It is a sonnet. It is almost unbearable. But what a fantastic night. It's a perfect night for a game of football. Two fantastic teams on the pitch. Scores sitting at 2-2. All to play for in this game.
0:2:0,"We've got Fabregas on the bench, we've got Alexis on the bench, a new signing for Barcelona We've got real competition in this team now, and it's going to be a tough game"
0:2:15,"A big crowd tonight as you would imagine and I think the people are really ready for it. They're caved up for this game tonight. They're singing, they're chanting, they're on the go."
0:2:30,there's not a wave going yet but they're ready for this match as we are normally we ready we're underway and barcelona have possession pk just being closed down there the ball bounces away of d maria and it'll be a three
0:2:45,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:3:0,again. Could be a chance here. Ronaldo is on to it. Oh and Valdez blocks it. It's away from the corner and Real Madrid have started in the same fashion. They started the first leg in the Bernabeu.
0:3:15,"Yn ddiweddaraf, yn gyntaf hynny, roedd Xavier Alonso yn cael y cyfle gwych a ddewisodd nad ydy'n gallu syrthu pan oedd e'n gallu gwneud yr union a ddecidiodd i'w pasio, ond yn unwaith eto, gadewch i ni weld y rhan yma a byddwn ni'n siarad am hynny."
0:3:30,the Portuguese star yeah as you're saying Xavi Alonso had a great opportunity
0:3:45,
0:4:0,"The kick, the by-kicks from the goalkeeper. Hold up. Hold on a minute, Di Maria's playing the ball forward. Benzema is offside and it'll be Barcelona's ball quickly taken free kick. Cedric Ramos there, playing the ball directly at goal."
0:4:15,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:4:30,"that happened in the opening 10-15 minutes of the Bernabeu. Can Real Madrid keep this rhythm, this pressing game up, especially in the stifling heat of the Catalan capital?"
0:4:45,"Real Madrid understand now how they can stop a very hot evening the whistles there were for Pepe, Pepe going down under a challenge from Villar and it's a free kick to Real Madrid, that free kick is played directly to Gabi Dahl, Gabi Dahl gets off into midfield"
0:5:0,midfield picked up momentarily by Xabi Alonso but it's Barcelona's ball lovely turn there first real moments from Messi just two minutes into the game as Villa plays it inside Xabi will push it back
0:5:15,"It's Mascherano, Mascherano and Pique are the players moving the ball around there. Brusquets. Brusquets in midfield, Brusquets down, Brusquets up."
0:5:30,"Mascherano, as I say, with Piquet at the back, Busquets is in the middle with Iniesta and Xabi in place of Keita. Oh, a lovely turn inside from Abi for Xabi. Xabi, I think looking for support on the left-hand side, it's Andres."
0:5:45,"Andres Iniesta though, he switches play, Dani Alves, Alves plays it across the area Villa looking for the angle, just gets off to Andres Iniesta, Iniesta looking through, Pepe picks up but the ball's Barcelona's again offside"
0:6:0,the left-hand side I would suggest that makes the Madrid back four just a little bit
0:6:15,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:6:30,It's very much high and wide. It's a ridiculous shot. Ronaldo takes a shot. He's on the angle. He's 25 yards out. And Pepe was physical enough but clean on this occasion.
0:6:45,a ball back it's bouncing around in midfield picked up by Real Madrid Pepe obviously the fans not happy with him after the events of the first leg I don't think they were happy with him before then. Cristiano Ronaldo oh and the decibels step up
0:7:0,"Coen Graub places it back at the feet of Casillas Cristiano Ronaldo play, breaks down in the middle but it falls to Xabi, Xabi will swing it back"
0:7:15,"Good cross field pass to Villa Villa looks to get around Sergio Ramos goes down, Sergio Ramos comes away with the ball, little back heel there Di Maria will oh a fine challenge from Villa Sergio Ramos flies into"
0:7:30,best of friends off the pitch we're told and the ball goes out for a throw to barcelona eric abidal will take seven minutes gone is barcelona nil realm a good nil yeah it's not midnight which we're almost at now so they're used to the heat and um and they'll survive
0:7:45,I'm sure of that. I don't think there'll be anybody as fixated tonight. Maybe it's just you and me that should do the trading. Abidal covering there as Uzi was almost through. Abidal now.
0:8:0,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:8:15,before he came into Mascherano but Barcelona have given the ball away and that's something we're not used to seeing Di Maria plays it off Abidal and Barca pick up and it's opening to the game
0:8:30,both teams giving the ball away now messi's on the ball offside against the argentinian here's the opposing superstar going down the left hand side cristiano ronaldo a lot to do to beat
0:8:45,"the Alberts gets the ball in and there's a foot on it as it goes across the area Steve someone should have been at the back post for Real Madrid maybe Yeah it's unusual to see Cristiano Ronaldo doing that, making a deal as play digital digital"
0:9:0,"Cristiano Ronaldo loses out to Dani Alves, Alves Busquets, Busquets to Iniesta Now the break is on for Barcelona Iniesta, he's got Villa to his left, Messi making a run into the box Instead it's Xabi, Xabi just can't get the angle for a shot He's got support though"
0:9:15,"Pedro joins him in, Magosias clears yeah messages if his leg would have been six inches longer it was in the back of the net he goes flying in at the front post and just misses it good ball in from Pedro"
0:9:30,"It really was tremendous ball from Pedro Barcelona on the attack again Villa in space on the left, Abidal will push it down to the excellent lengthier forward Villa, fellow World Cup winner, should be chubby now"
0:9:45,"Llanfairdd ar ôl i Piquet, Andres Iniesta, Asherano Barcelona Cadw ar y ffyrdd yng nghanolbarth, Pedro ar hyn o bryd Pedro ar hyn o bryd, Xabi"
0:10:0,"Yn ôl i Pepe, mae Madrid wedi gwblio'r bwl, ond mae Mascherano wedi'i gael yn ôl. Mae'r heriau anhygoel gan Mascherano. Aby Dalnow i mewn i fi."
0:10:15,time he picks the ball up and he is making a good use of it so Pedro's got to be a little bit more positive against Coentraal because he's really got him in his pocket if he wants it it's that battle again this time though Coentraal facing Messi there really is no competition
0:10:30,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:10:45,1-0 to FCB
0:11:0,"He saw it coming, he should have picked him up or gone to make the chance instead of standing up and holding Sandberg That's a lazy man's defending and it should never happen Certainly not at this level Real Madrid now have to score two goals"
0:11:15,"They've only scored one on their last four visits to the new camp It's a free kick that's been awarded to Barcelona They're Madrid who will feel that they started, certainly the first So a big advantage, all advantage with them"
0:11:30,and the stadium I can tell you is rocking the people there's people dancing they're not just celebrating the goal and Barcelona moving forward again Leo Messi finds Villa in space
0:11:45,and be offside looking across the line if he's offside with all the time he's got to look across that lane i would get my yellow card offside in that situation come on
0:12:0,He does it week in week out. Let's look at it again in replay. Hopefully we get a replay. Here it comes. Doesn't look like he's offside to me when the pass is made. It was tight wasn't it and er... Oh the little...
0:12:15,"A little push there by Sergio Ramos on Villa as he played the ball away Sergio Ramos of course, I think he's gone out for dinner after the game with Dani Alves They've been chatting or tweeting to each other all week As Barcelona pick up the ball in midfield"
0:12:30,"Messi was almost through there Just picked up by Carvalho Madrid and Neckar trying to hold a high line again Keeping their line, their defensive line, high up the pitch And it's not on Coentrão loses out to Pique"
0:12:45,picked up by Kadira. Kadira pulled more there. Messi in space on the far side as Steve said but it's Di Maria with the ball. Oh he's flicked it over it's a decent ball. Kadira oh he's played it back to Benzema and Benzema.
0:13:0,was the Benzema of the first half of last season not the Benzema of pre-season really didn't do anything with that ball it was the best almost chance of the game Buzio with the corner
0:13:15,left foot swings it in goes all the way across the area they're looking for a penalty handball Ronaldo is in the net Cristiano Ronaldo it looks
0:13:30,offside initially we'll have to have another look and Cristiano Ronaldo after 90 minutes slowing stepping up and it is indeed 1-1 just four minutes after in the Estonian football Sloan ahead
0:13:45,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:14:0,fantastic piece to the game as well. It's what we want.
0:14:15,Pedro haeddi honohono Matheson a'r Tabernedig Serbia Eon Lawch Udillodwyd un tro Mawrthi
0:14:30,"where he is, he's caught off the pitch, he's caught out of position, and that passes on. Jose Mourinho's men. Might be a headache he's got, because he's under enormous pressure. He certainly looks dizzy, he looks dizzy. One of four Portuguese players playing under pressure."
0:14:45,Portuguese manager will be a corner to Barcelona chubby will play it in low headed on towards the back post and into the hands of Casillas you look at the replay in a free kick if we get it the way
0:15:0,Other referee doesn't give a penalty is beyond me referees that want to be stronger le persuasion est positif He's just a very cuddly tupí yeah barceloning
0:15:15,possession Pique halfway through the first half it's Barcelona one Real Madrid one and this is a real football match just as Sunday's was and so far touch would be looking but
0:15:30,so you want to give pedro that much space surely you want to make him a less you know a target that uh midfield are not going to spot so easily
0:15:45,"Oh, and the ball's broken in favour of Real Madrid and Valdez comes out of his area and clears There'll be a throw-in to Real Madrid Steve, play is breaking down in midfield and Bocer... Yeah, yeah, it was Piquet that made a bad pass"
0:16:0,Blaid Llanfairddael Colau
0:16:15,"Ar y diwrnod hwnnw, mae'r Rheol Madrid yn fwy atagof yng nghanol y diwrnod diwethaf, yn ogystal â'r diwrnod diwethaf pan fyddan nhw'n chwarae Barcelona. Mae'n gwneud y gwaith yn gwahanol i roi'r ball arnyn nhw. Y flwyddyn diwethaf, roi ball arnyn nhw ac mae Barcelona wedi llosu'r ball."
0:16:30,"this year. They're not letting her have the ball and closing down the playmakers whenever they're on the ball as you can see now. And how much of a risk is that though? No, no, that's exactly what they've got to do. They can't win against Barcelona any other way."
0:16:45,"Ronaldo against Dani Alves, the bounce falls to Dani Alves He plays it inside to Mascherano, returns the ball to the Brazilian fullback Alves, now inside to Xabi Amanda, he finds it Yes! He's got the ball back to Pedro, no offside"
0:17:0,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:17:15,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:17:30,"5 minutes gone, Barca 1, Madrid 1"
0:17:45,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:18:0,"The power of that has just come through in Valdez's hands, you'll see again in the replay in a minute, it was just too powerful He goes to try and push it away, but the shot is so powerful it bends his hands back"
0:18:15,and uh it crashes onto the crossbar fantastic effort from ronaldo from outside the box contrao loses the ball picked up by barcelona they're being closed down the ball will be pushed at moldez
0:18:30,"this time beating Pedro but Madrid almost give him the ball away he's picked up now by Ozil, Ozil double challenge loses the ball"
0:18:45,Mae'n anhygoel. Bydd hynny'n cerddoriaeth i Cadira. Cadira yw'r ffocus. Nid yw'r ffocus ar y ball. A oedd Cadira? Oedd Cadira'r ffocus ar y ball.
0:19:0,"Speaking of the evening like to see it again because as you said Steve it's kind of off the ball Let's have another look. He tackles Busquets, he thinks Busquets taking it, comes right through Busquets And then Busquets goes down. Fortunately Busquets jumped out of the way and there was hardly any"
0:19:15,"when he contacted Busquets, he was able to continue It was a wonderful ball forward there I think it was Busquets who clipped it through for Pedro who the beating again of Coentrao and luckily for Coentrao, Casillas"
0:19:30,"This was sharp and alert, it comes out and clears the danger."
0:19:45,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:20:0,the ball is out for a corner albert's going crazy but i think you see there was no offside abidal playing everybody on again he needs theirs you know what i'd like to see as well players not playing in the lines
0:20:15,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:20:30,he's saying it's a poor effort goal kick to FCB I see the replay that's a Ronaldo's treat getting in Barcelona's half as quickly as he can and picking the play up from there
0:20:45,"It's a pressure game they're playing, and they're playing it very well. Mourinho's obviously got them well drilled in it. He's obviously discussed it with them, shown them it, and they worked really, really hard at it."
0:21:0,"the modern game there. Mourinho on the edge of his technical area, Pep Guardiola just sitting down for a moment, but two managers are really involved for the whole 90 minutes. Runs through to Victor Valdez, hence the applause from the culés."
0:21:15,"Na Sharano on the ball Abidal to his left Na Sharano on the left-hand side of the centre-half pairing Piqué on the right, Dani Alves on the right back and Abidal on the left Na Sharano!"
0:21:30,It could really be a yellow card for Coentraal for stopping a promising attack from Pedro
0:21:45,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:22:0,He really has made Di Maria look silly on a couple of occasions so far
0:22:15,"is inside. Di Maria, Di Maria hardly challenging, Pique, Messi, loses out, Pepe, that was Pepe"
0:22:30,i gael mynd allan ar Gymru'n rhain. Mae copi yn gallu lle capen pasient a mae niferoedd yn cenedlas yn deyrno各 gwus apel y gosodion yw'r anrhydeithiol ar argymhell y bôn.
0:22:45,"Carvalho is the man now on Leo Messi, so the ball, long ball forward, picked up by Pepe. Pepe heads it down to Coentraal. Rozier looking to make the run down the centre. Coentraal instead finds Ronaldo."
0:23:0,May have just be caught and Sergio Ramos takes no chances
0:23:15,It just looked so comfortable in that left-back position Owen Neomessi has just turned inside Xabi Alonso is still on the run Feeds it! Looking to feed it through to Xabi but...
0:23:30,the Sears picks up it's always the danger of course we saw that the weekend Leo Messi's not really doing too much and then boom he strikes and then what then he strikes
0:23:45,I Believe that one with you to you
0:24:0,"a couple of runs in the opening minutes beats Ancaldi Maria has been very quiet now play switch to the far side Alvarez brings the ball down wonderfully for Pique and Pique chooses to, I don't want to sort of hook it up into midfield now it's Cristiano"
0:24:15,"Ronaldo has not got the beating of Dani Alves so far in this game 10 minutes to half time, Ronaldo desperate for a throw in Doesn't get it, the whistles start up by Barcelona"
0:24:30,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:24:45,What's going on there? Gets the ball off to Xabi Alonso Ronaldo will attack Dani Alves again Ronaldo Alves with a perfect sliding challenge
0:25:0,Llywodraeth Cymru
0:25:15,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:25:30,"Xabi with the short corner, gets the ball back off Leo Messi, Xabi driving to the byline he'll pull it back, it's out for another corner, that Baio taking no chances it's an incredible piece of this game"
0:25:45,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:26:0,"He drives it in, it could have gone anywhere It's gone all the way through Xabi now will play it back Alves look to be lining up, he's closed down by Coentrao Real Madrid struggling to get the ball away Caught by Busquets It's Villa on the far side He drives in"
0:26:15,still via gets it to the edge chubby inside to Gerard Piquet Piquet almost to the penalty spot the shots just not coming could still happen those Piquet has it plays inside here the Estonians
0:26:30,Llywodraeth y Llywodraeth yng Nghymru
0:26:45,"it was. We'll see again in the replay, but it certainly catches him. Was it Pepe or was it Benzema? I think it was Pepe. Let's have another look at that one. Yeah, it was Pepe. Nah. I have my doubts."
0:27:0,"I'm not as hysterical as everyone else but Pepe, it is Pepe and errrr Anyway, action continues Barcelona in midfield Ball is lost by Busquets, picked up again Oh and errrr"
0:27:15,Madeira saying he was pushed into making that foul Madeira I think claiming it was a Barcelona player that pushed him into
0:27:30,uniester and i think with some reason brusquets just nudged him there cadillac have to watch out he's the only player on a yellow card so far as barcelona move forward abidal on the left hand side plays it inside
0:27:45,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:28:0,"will be a throw-in in favor of Real Madrid. I don't know why they switched Villa and Pedro. Pedro had the beating on Coentrao all night long. The attacking duty is around and give Villa a go at Coentrao. As you say, he really is..."
0:28:15,"He is not the weak link, he is a tremendous player But he is not having an enjoyable evening Nor is Cristiano Ronaldo But it's Ronaldo now moving down the left hand side This time it's Martial Danilo who faces him Martial Danilo stands!"
0:28:30,up to Ronaldo and comes away with the ball inside to Xabi and Ronaldo apart from that wonderful shot that Valdez somehow pushed onto the crossbar has not enjoyed the evening as much as he would have liked
0:28:45,did of course score the goal and there'll be a yellow card for Chappie Chappie with this challenge becomes well
0:29:0,the Portuguese left-back is still down but it's hot take a break
0:29:15,Colin Proud gets to his feet. Nobody seems too bothered about taking the free kick. It looks like Carvalho will do so.
0:29:30,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:29:45,"minutes gone. I can only say the pace of the game and the heat, the only thing I'd say is it's the beginning of the season where neither team have really had any competitive matches. This has certainly taken a lot out of both teams."
0:30:0,and they're still going at it uh 100 miles an hour. Paul Dulles the ball's played in and Uzil couldn't get it. Paul Smacherano I think was a rather desperate call for handball by the Argentinian referee.
0:30:15,"Yn ddiweddaraf, mae PK yn y ball. PK yw'n chwarae yn y ffwrdd. Viya yw ar gyfer Coentrau. Mae'n chwarae yn y ffwrdd i Alves. Alves yw'n cael Chabi. Chabi yw eisiau fwy. Chabi yw eisiau fwy. Chabi yw eisiau fwy."
0:30:30,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:30:45,because at the moment de maria is attacking abby dalva there's a attacking de maria much more than the other way around now chances pedro is on the edge of the box looks to drive it in and he'll take the corner
0:31:0,Two minutes to half time. Tremendous time to score and take your team into the lead. Let's not forget Barcelona already in the lead on aggregate. The away goals count double.
0:31:15,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:31:30,"Leo Messi has made it 2-1 to FC Barcelona Well that's another fantastic goal, Messi clips it over Casillas again"
0:31:45,"from a corner, ball breaks to Piquet who's going away from goal he back-heels it through to Messi Messi takes a couple of touches, Casillas comes out to him and Messi just coolly clips it over him and into the back of the net"
0:32:0,another fantastic goal see again replay comes from a corner breaks the PK he's gone away from going back he's looked at Messi Messi flips it over Casillas fantastic goal under pressure
0:32:15,"P. K. F. Facing away from go going away from it. Macy's on to the flash, chasing him and falls to his knees at last second. Can't get close enough to him to get the challenge. See again. He launched Ronaldo chasing after falls to his knees."

0:33:0,Gameplay presentado en nuestra travelling virtual a las 11 de la tarde
0:33:15,"and the referee decides it's half time Pep Guardiola not happy with the challenge on Iniesta, it was a push by Sergio Ramos and before anything can be done"
0:33:30,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:33:45,"Welcome back to the second half. It's Real Madrid who are taking the field first. Hence the whistles. We're waiting for Barcelona to come out. Andres Iniesta, just seeing him in the tunnel there, alongside Dani Alaves."
0:34:0,Commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:34:15,"league the Barcelona are enjoying 2-1 on the night, 4-3 on aggregate, a goal from Real Madrid, a goal from Real Madrid to make it 2-0 would mean extra time, extra time impossible."
0:34:30,We could end up leaving this stadium at 2 o'clock in the morning.
0:34:45,and he has Messi. Messi's got Martello to attack Stead plays it to Villa. Villa's shot is blocked. What is he playing at? Cointreau gets a
0:35:0,"Pepe, sorry, on this near side got a very soft... Oh, and Alves has gifted the ball, Ozil now will play it down to Ronaldo. Ronaldo has to step inside, shoot..."
0:35:15,"He had, Steve, I know you're a big fan of Ronaldo, but he had three options in the middle of the box there. Yeah, Nick was obviously joking when he said he was a big fan of Ronaldo. He did have three options inside the box."
0:35:30,"He's got three, four players in second box, and goes for the shot from the back... I think Macerano... And there'll be one for a Real Madrid player It's...Oh! It's Cristiano Ronaldo"
0:35:45,"You can see the jump. Marcello certainly studs Messi. Messi's coming closer and he studs him, there's no doubt about it. And Leo Messi and oh they're like men, they're like mating, I think it's deers that do that. Marcello and Messi just head to head."
0:36:0,"Dani Alves there as well, I don't want to shy away"
0:36:15,I hope the Catalan press pick up on that Steve because there were bad sounds directed at Dani Alves in the Bernabeu and we've just heard exactly the same against Marcello in the Camp Nou
0:36:30,He's that tapered guy. You see it week in week out. Certainly it is a tremendous back four when you think of it. Carl Vajo and Sergio Ramos at the
0:36:45,"They're the calm guys in this back four for Real Madrid Viii... Oh, there was no flag Handball on the far side, hence Viya didn't go for it But, as I was saying, Sergio Ramos and Carvalho both have their moments"
0:37:0,
0:37:15,Although I'm just getting tired of that Steve I really am that players started And somebody is deliberately from the ball onto the pitch And it's just a continuation
0:37:30,There are more whistles now and applause because the prodigal son has returned. Cesc Fabregas. Will we see him this evening? Will we see Alexis? Will we see Thiago? Plenty of firepower.
0:37:45,on the bench of Sergio Ramos has made a run forward the shot over Breda already pushed Abidal free kick given in favor of FCB Iguain the substitute warming up
0:38:0,In
0:38:15,He's going all the way and Casillas saves Real Madrid out for a corner
0:38:30,"Good support from Marcello for Benzema. Benzema plays a simple pass, Marcello crosses it, good pace on it, but BK comes across and clears it near post, out for a corner."
0:38:45,the second half barcelona leading to one but one goal would take us into extra time snapped up that one steve yes no
0:39:0,a oedd yn dod yn dda. Bydd oedd yn dda. Bydd oedd yn dda. It will be Real Madrid's ball. It will be Real Madrid's ball. Chabbi Alonso. Dreadful ball by Chabbi Alonso. Dreadful ball by Chabbi Alonso. Finds Mascherano. Finds Mascherano. Picks up in midfield.
0:39:15,"Brusquets plays it forward. Oh, and they almost fell for it. Oh, what's Pedro doing? Pepe, rather. Pepe has caught Pedro, and it's another one of those challenges, Steve, that just don't make sense. I don't think he caught him out of the tension."
0:39:30,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:39:45,a pinball of a goal it's Benzema who has drawn
0:40:0,level for Real Madrid and there are only nine minutes to go and Real Madrid have doubled their goal they've scored one in four before this evening now they've got two
0:40:15,
0:40:30,"Benzema just turns, has a swing at it, and bowlings up in the back of the net. There's the cheer. Barcelona may have just conceded a goal, but as Pedro goes off, it's the return of Cesc Fabinho."
0:40:45,"Fabregas to his home, Chaby swings it in, it's headed away by Sergio Ramos but picked up now by Andres Iniesta, Iniesta chips it, oh dear me!"
0:41:0,That could have been a dream return!
0:41:15,the ball here for making the cross from right-hand side Fabregas was alone in the back oh and the ball now with Adriano
0:41:30,Leo Messi! Leo Messi! Leo Messi! Barcelona 3-2 3 minutes to go
0:41:45,
0:42:0,"The first leg's to you. Yeah, I think so. All it needs now... Oh, Fabregas! He's put Messi through! Messi bludgeoning! Oh, Kassius, Kassius, Kassius blocks. It was so unlucky."
0:42:15,"It's a lucky little ball in from Fabregas, he tried to... It's Barcelona on the attack, Adriano Marcelo was flying in, lucky he didn't connect Messi, inside to Fabregas, Fabregas..."
