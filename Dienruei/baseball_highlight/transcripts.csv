start,transcript
0:0:0,twenty one year old right hander against Randy Roser and the first pitch of the night here in Miami is a fastball at one hundred and one miles an hour. We're going to see that one hundred and one miles an hour and I would think it's fastball and then adjust.
0:0:15,Rosarito's and another great tournament here just thrives in these big game spots got the call that time Rosarito didn't think so and he's talking to Quinn Wolcott who's our home plate umpire about it.
0:0:30,He just wants to know hey you're going to give him that it's going to be a long night for these hitters. So Saki throws and a total breakdown of a swing wanted to.
0:0:45,one to through it again it looked like it missed to a two
0:1:0,and strikes out swinging 1 0 2 or Max coming at you only Shohei Ohtani really in the history of Japanese baseball has thrown as hard as this guy.
0:1:15,He starts off Alex for Dugo with a splitter because this guy is so polished and of course he has pitched at the highest level in Japan he is already a professional and a very successful professional.
0:1:30,pitcher in a competitive Japanese league innings fifty two batters across the street who does handle velocity maybe not that velocity it's one to two.
0:1:45,that's hard to hit a hundred up out of the strike zone so good with that fastball up in the zone right there. Got two ways to go here. So Saki is one to.
0:2:0,to Verdugo to left field and deep hit it very well but not quite well enough caught right at the edge of you got to hit it and then you got to hit it some more to get it out of here especially to left field.
0:2:15,Now a guy Joey Meneses we know he has power it's just after eight ten in the morning Tokyo time tomorrow from where we sit Tuesday morning in Tokyo.
0:2:30,The television ratings viewership of these world baseball classics the whole country essentially has been watching this Japanese team Well then I would say konnichiwa Good morning to everybody in Tokyo
0:2:45,for.
0:3:0,Two down bases empty Manassas waiting to strike pitch. He struck him out in the dirt the splitter. There's the tag for the put or look this guy he's no he's no he's not surprised against team.
0:3:15,USA he's up for another challenge against Japan is an established major league starting pitcher he doesn't have but he's good he's going to challenge you.
0:3:30,It's got a lot of heart it's going to be around the zone not going to walk anybody. It's got really good feel like that. Wanted to do the first player and he's kind of become.
0:3:45,a massive star in that country. I would think this is the bait pitch right here. Not so much an action pitch. And it worked. To start the bottom of the first. There goes the fastball.
0:4:0,"about 37% of the time, which is a mix of the four seam and the two seam. So, you got to pick and choose your battle with him. Kondo has hit a home run and four doubles already in this tournament."
0:4:15,right now he's going to see how
0:4:30,A lot of time to fastball up in the zone. Of Pondo. He's got lightning hands. He can catch up to that heater up in the zone.
0:4:45,to the left hands catcher behind the plate Austin Barnes is a good player for the Dodgers.
0:5:0,the middle defense from Mexico has been strong. Classic. Another one to strike right to go on the outside.
0:5:15,"Really sharp with all his pitches, I know it's been a basketball slider, but it's been great So now The great Otani Will nod to his teammates"
0:5:30,All the arching him stand in for the first time in this semifinal game he's dominated this tournament so far.
0:5:45,The in the seventh inning.
0:6:0,the 0 1 even his teammates. You can't miss this at bat.
0:6:15,and the lineup from the
0:6:30,but it's gone.
0:6:45,and the dirt bounce that change up the pitching prowess you heard J.P. tell us there's a chance if Japan can advance to the championship we could see him.
0:7:0,him on the mound tomorrow. Tonight he's the D.H. to do. Stop the outside sound of all thought he had and you've got to dominate with your fastball but you've got to be very careful with this guy right here.
0:7:15,Full count to Shohei Ohtani three to pitch is straight three. Japanese team had to travel from Tokyo and they basically just arrived in town when he came to Japan.
0:7:30,So instead of holding up in a hotel room and just sleeping off some jet lag he was here at the ballpark facing Roddy Till is here to start the second inning no score.
0:7:45,"Back up the middle and right into the defense for our number one. And we talked to Kuriyama, the manager for Japan. Having, you know, five days off, said, well, Darvish was very big with that. He was very informational. He asked, hey, everybody go home."
0:8:0,Everybody try to work out kind of get it off of you for the most part they're OK they practice and they feel like they're very prepared for tonight's game. And that is why their quarter finals took place several days before the quarterfinal games here just to allow the.
0:8:15,of teams that played across the world to travel here and get acclimated fastball to Isaac Paredes misses high ball one six hits but a bunch of big hits for Mexico in this world baseball classic.
0:8:30,right against right and he takes a strike right in there. You mentioned it Sasaki it's once in a while throws a pitch one hundred miles an hour. He basically sits at one hundred for a full start.
0:8:45,at age 21 it's special try that
0:9:0,Or maybe that was just a splitter that came out a little funny went to the backstop two and one major Martinez about the splitter Asked him. Can you really do that? Can you make the splitter go from side to side? Will and Pedro said absolutely
0:9:15,It's just a matter of how you grip it and what pressure you put on what I would think you would see a fastball here challenge the big boy.
0:9:30,field that's going to be a hit for the first two of the game comes from the soccer it is cut off in the outfield by Yoshida and holds Paredes to a one out single. We know he had a big game against Puerto Rico wasting no getting in.
0:9:45,Only three hits so far but very capable friendly call for Sasaki strike one. To the. Japanese first baseman.
0:10:0,to I'm sure not real comfortable down 0 2 having seen those two pitches here it comes.
0:10:15,Off the outside with the split. Trejo waiting to hit next. Mexican fans start to come to life in the stands.
0:10:30,Pedro's point when you talk to him about throwing that split finger pitch was you can manipulate it's not just throw it and see which way moves you have some control.
0:10:45,control is the pitcher over that's very hard to control but in sessions and you don't know what it wants to do to you to another right there there's not that much action there there's not that much side thing about Japan if you're going to beat him
0:11:0,"You've got to beat them, and it's got to be a clean game. You've got to punt the ball. You've got to run the bases the right way. You've got to get the crucial hits and play good defense. They're just not going to give you a game. They're not going to walk guys. They're not going to play sloppy."
0:11:15,Another one to Riaz right back up to Sasaki and hit the pitcher maybe right in the midsection and Riaz will be safe at first.
0:11:30,here you've got to give Luis Urias credit just behind the count 0 2 Saki throw a practice pitch to make sure he's OK
0:11:45,just a little practice pitch at ninety three miles an hour. Why not. Yeah that's the get it in velocity. Just get it in there. Let me just feel my way to it.
0:12:0,chance to put Mexico ahead in this game just off the outside. OK so the game starts again right back to 1 0.
0:12:15,really stay on that heater
0:12:30,with a whole lot of nuance. Alan Trejo struggled to hit his solid player good defensive shortstop last that bad the one one was a soft count but if it ain't broke.
0:12:45,Why fix it to throw that heater and again those misses are small misses like down fastball split mostly as you said he'll show the slider in the curveball every once in a while.
0:13:0,What is his go to righties or lefties. Fastball on the ground should be to there's one throw to first got a double play five gold gloves is entering the league in twenty seventeen. That's pretty special.
0:13:15,We're going to see a lot more of had to play there's Genda player. We were just talking about the shortstop Had a great tournament so far By the Boston
0:13:30,Austin Red Sox in the offseason to a big con with RBI is Trey Turner extra base power.
0:13:45,Baseball use that change up one to two. The main questions he's shown power in Japan will that power translate to big league baseball. Not a huge question for tonight. We know he's capable in this setting. He hits out on a line back up the middle base.
0:14:0,"So the first hit for Japan, Yoshida with a lead-off single That's an absolute rocket that works in the big leagues that works in any how left-handed heavy this Japanese lineup is another lefty comes up here Moritaka"
0:14:15,Tommy the third baseman fastball for a strike guy has put up huge numbers in MLB but he has not had a great world.
0:14:30,baseball classic and I think he's been deceptive to that. Oh yeah. First an average homerun so he won the Triple Crown. I'm glad the league and runs on base slugging that was a huge year.
0:14:45,in the dirt and a great block by Austin Barnes the catcher. One of the things I love about Murakami is the way he sets up his front foot. You know he doesn't have it just just there. He has it kind of on his tippy toes to feel that weight.
0:15:0,most hitters tend to do that to feel rhythm to feel weight with his back hip he has that rhythm that ankles always moving up and down up and down up and down
0:15:15,That's for the 1 2 and he took the fastball as his timing mechanism where most guys use their timing with their hands. He's actually using it with the front toe of his right leg. Edgar Martinez used to tell me that as a hitting as a.
0:15:30,hitting coach in Seattle he says hey you know you're a Latin guy you can dance you got to have a little rhythm make sure you're just not still you know you look like a robot out there have a little bit of more rhythm as you see right there look he's always moving it
0:15:45,to to inside of all strikes and outswinging that's a good slider right there. Good good hack but for Monte Tucker Murakami.
0:16:0,You have to imagine in Japan there is a little pressure building on him from the outside at least because of what a big star he is chopper to short the flip to second that's one for the first double play double play.
0:16:15,So Saki back to work here in the third strike one. Alec Thomas the hitter for Mexico.
0:16:30,"A good athlete in his own right. Excellent defensive center fielder. Early in his young, bigly career has struggled to hit. Big bounce with the first. Taken there by O'Reilly."
0:16:45,He's got that splitter word or first right to make hitters kind of chase after it I think I do have an idea in the lineup there's a lot of communication going on in that game.
0:17:0,that dugout in Mexico saying all right got to pick pick and choose our battle here what picture we attack fastball to Austin Barnes called Swan to hear any more from the Mexican dugout well we know one thing we will he's
0:17:15,He's got a short fuse they'll let you know quick we've had great conversations throughout the games in my time you and Quinn very good ones love cafe Cito's and empanadas just like me.
0:17:30,the 0 1 pitch fastball really talked about how his day was going Austin Barnes I think he's been a big difference maker for this team.
0:17:45,absolutely they're fast moving for a strike while these hitters.
0:18:0,one to off the outside through that splitter just missed a good split action here to two out of time to throw that slider.
0:18:15,hitters thinking OK fastball right now fastballs coming you throw it off with that split be very tough to two and he threw another off speed pitch full count
0:18:30,on deck if you're Barnes you got to know it's coming 3 2 on the ground the third he didn't throw the fastball a little bottle there but enough time for more comedy to throw out Austin Barnes.
0:18:45,Barnes two down so two outs for Rosarito struck out his first time up he takes a breaking ball for a strike.
0:19:0,always and maybe it's unfair of me you got to think and we're coming struck out in the last half inning goes back out on defense at third I always wonder whether maybe a little the focus still on.
0:19:15,in the at bat that didn't go so well but he made the play or you try not to doesn't mean you don't think about it from time to time or else rain a swing punch shot to.
0:19:30,But the results have been excellent on both sides. Tatsuto Yamada right handed hitter he goes after the first pitch from Sandoval fouls it out of play.
0:19:45,I always talk to guys that had more power it doesn't matter if it goes out of the stadium as long as we get the job done that's what matters I think it's the same thing for pitching you can throw 100 I can throw ninety three to ninety five but I'm getting these hitters out it's the same thing.
0:20:0,comes in all sizes weight and height doesn't matter as long as you can play the game you can play it.
0:20:15,tonight Japan trying for its third all time world baseball classic championship they won the first two haven't won since then went away here tonight from playing for a championship tomorrow.
0:20:30,foul off to the right some very big inning for Sandoval you got seven eight nine coming up you want to make sure you put a clean inning here actually in this lineup for their defense yeah all-around play
0:20:45,You want to start rallies it usually comes from the seven eight nine hitters Struck him out all that dandy that change-up is unhittable
0:21:0,One out. Strike two. The left-handed hitting shortstop J.P. was talking. See that pinky finger on his bottom hand. Wrapped up. Bunce.
0:21:15,Sandoval off the mound and throws him out. That's a good job right there by Sandoval. Really gets off the mound well. More reps than BFPs.
0:21:30,He did a great job overall he pitched four innings for Team USA helped him get the win. Did not have a great night fielding his position all one to the ninth place hitter Nakamura.
0:21:45,that's a good change of count right here. Let's see if you get some soft contact with it. Here we go then. Money Mono.
0:22:0,three time winner of the Golden Glove defensive catcher for the cold swallows in Tokyo fly ball down the right field line.
0:22:15,that one just beyond the reach of Alex Verdugo wanted to clear that as a distinguished career 14 seasons.
0:22:30,one to a little check swing looping liner caught by second or for Mexico Alex Verdugo takes a high stretch through.
0:22:45,Well shake in his head like man. Off the inside.
0:23:0,a big count here stayed with it
0:23:15,Yeah he's staying with it especially later in the game. He's got a good really good feel for it. Usually when he's got good feel for it like that early on he will continue to have good feel for it later on in the game and he'll come reliable become his pitch that he goes to.
0:23:30,doing key spots that he wants to win the count on his head one two and he struck him out just never deviated leagues.
0:23:45,And he may not see many more fastballs tonight. One out for Joey Manessas there's a fastball.
0:24:0,going on right now with Sasaki his adjustment periods right now and he read a lot of these hitters in the first time through. This is to left field Yoshida catches it on the edge of the warning track two down.
0:24:15,it's the hair at the end of the ball yeah hey man i just missed it just a little bit more against team USA than SS did
0:24:30,it did in pool play Roddy Tellez Fergie now.
0:24:45,School told as right over top the splitter Kala's now is you gotta cover zone cover up in the zone at one hundred and two you gotta cover zone. You gotta spread like a feather ball. Say that out now at three
0:25:0,you can cover the split down under to he's in a pickle right here. Big hole until his answer time.
0:25:15,and nobody's there at third he
0:25:30,Oh well that's a really good two strike approach right there. Oh it's just hey I'm going to pick right here I'm going to try to get a good pitch big hitters though nowadays they're seeing a hundred.
0:25:45,a lot. Zacharias who had a base hit his first time up comes up for the second time and just a little bit. His catcher thought that was a strike. Benji Hill a manager for Mexico.
0:26:0,He really likes this player. Strike it's one to one. And a really good year for the Rays. So far these one one counts have been soft.
0:26:15,What parade is this in two fastballs. You got the splitter there one or two. The problem with the 1 1 counts man. You know he's gone soft with him but you just respect him.
0:26:30,back to fastball so much you had your chance early on in this at bat now you're in a little bit of a hole could be action pitch here runner at first two down the one to just stays alive against the splitter.
0:26:45,the Broncos maybe Series 4 your parade is here. You've got to pick and choose your best the zone's got to be up one two.
0:27:0,that's a guy that's showing me he wants to make sure he's the right hander a lot of times we're seeing nowadays in the big leagues finish right handers off
0:27:15,Get the bright nail polish to make for easier visuals on the catcher's signals to two on the ground foul by third right on right.
0:27:30,this is two at bats where he has really hung in there against this sensational young right hander he's seen a lot of pitches down in this game big spot for the Hermit Crabb
0:27:45,Parades. Tutu he hits a little pop up behind third and it's going to fall.
0:28:0,hit Murakami picked it up off the balance so Sarge a bit of a stressful situation wins the game. Big moment here Luis Arias he
0:28:15,He hit the ball that came right back to Sasaki and hit him in the stomach just a little late. That pitch was right down the middle but at 100 miles an hour.
0:28:30,"But just a little late, he's got to shorten up. One thing to keep in mind, Donny Telles, the lead runner, does not have a lot of speed."
0:28:45,They said to the outfield not guaranteed that he could score Oh one Maria's to Latvia
0:29:0,"Mexico! Magdalena, Mexico! Mexico's final!"
0:29:15,Luis Urias cuts huge! What a moment! Wow!
0:29:30,"Hanging splitter, Dave. He got the hanging splitter for a base hit. And the first time back, hanging splitter again for Rick Homer."
0:29:45,Biggest hit of his young career.
0:30:0,strike it's on to so many titles got right there two outs nobody on the ground ball to beat the shift nobody was a third old pop up broken back pop up at three hits all tournament until tonight.
0:30:15,Saki misses up in a way wanted to all of a sudden now he started this ending at forty four pitches up to sixty three
0:30:30,Makes the throw three innings top of the order Lars Newt Barr and team Japan's got some work to do. They sure do. Strike one. Luis Arias with the nickname huge. Tonight's ballgame.
0:30:45,New bar struck out in his first at bat hits big bouncer on the first base side foul. So he falls behind in the count 0 and 2.
0:31:0,Japan does have the bullpen working number 18 out of the bullpen guys really in terms
0:31:15,Those are just success and numbers the most accomplished pitcher right now in Japan. Newt Barr right into the defense. Trejo throws him out. Point location.
0:31:30,and that's been the key right there pinpoint location not really falling behind these hitters getting strike one on a soft pitches early on it's getting calm.
0:31:45,So this is a key hitter for Japan. McTonnie sound of all that.
0:32:0,it's 2 and 0 I think a lot has to do with that you just lose it for a little bit as you know. Hey I can't have this guy get on first base. It's a problem.
0:32:15,If the play by play guy notices the presence of the on deck hit or you can bet this lefty heavy lineup for Japan good matchup for Patrick Sandoval.
0:32:30,That one on the ground in the right field base hit. So Kondo comes through with the second hit of the game for Japan and there will be a base runner on for Ohtani. That's a good piece of hitting right there.
0:32:45,"of all he wants that slider back a slider had no bite to Tommy against his angels teammate. And the first half back, Sandoval threw him a couple of change ups kind of had show hey a little bit of this sport."
0:33:0,Does he go back to that change up or is it more of the fastball slider combo. One thing's for sure though. He's got to have pinpoint location. With a very dangerous hitter. The power of the. Motani displayed during batting.
0:33:15,practice today was breathtaking waiting for the first pitch from Sandoval and it's in the dirt. Nice pick by Austin Barnes.
0:33:30,Ohtani was hitting the ball to places in this ballpark that I did not know were possible to reach way up in there He hit the he hit the video board on the fly When I pulled it a little more he literally hit it second deck
0:33:45,or excellent for fastball addiction was bad in practice though so taking a long time and he misses with a fast it is different.
0:34:0,But it was amazing. Third base side and foul out of play.
0:34:15,"The coolest part about batting practice was that it was him and new bar that we're hitting. They were the only ones hitting and everybody was just watching and when Shohei was done, batting practice was over. Okay team, we're ready. We're ready."
0:34:30,He hit a homer to dead center. He says we're good. Pack it up. Let's go. He got a standing ovation. From all the fans here. Just a remarkably. We haven't even talked about the pitching and the hitting combo doing things like that.
0:34:45,that nobody in the history of the game's ever done it's just on these spectacular MLB success I would be surprised about the season on the.
0:35:0,fastball here a change of account but three one and it's a strike. He was really fooled by that he throws a three one.
0:35:15,Can we see a three to the change of the plan here though too. I like the change of. Three to. Tommy. Left center field it's going to be caught.
0:35:30,Well as you describe us we're in awe as well and we're supposed to be these cool customers well we weren't earlier today.
0:35:45,video camera the phone camera out just watching him put on the show. I was in awe. Yeah and I mean we hit that last ball that line out one hundred and ten miles an hour on one handed.
0:36:0,special to down Yoshida who has a base hit already slashes that one foul off to the left he's behind in the count 0 2 at 14 years old.
0:36:15,was outstanding saw him hit a ball the other way for a homer and I knew Yep this guy is going to be able to do both things even he could not have imagined the high level success because it's it's literally a game of God.
0:36:30,It's really never happened before ever 0 2 that one is lined in the left base hit so you know she does two for two.
0:36:45,Kondo heads to third the throw comes back in towards second and Japan is threatening. I just. Talk of Morikami has not been smiling much in his.
0:37:0,four for 18 without a home run what a spot this would be for him to break out two on two out and a foul
0:37:15,He's just leaking a little bit the breaking balls got to simplify it and slow it down from it's only the fourth inning. They don't need to tie the game with one swing.
0:37:30,But a run would be a big answer on one that is a slider first right. That's a good one right there that had bite.
0:37:45,He goes back to that slider it's got to be a wasted pitch.
0:38:0,doing balls down in the zone but if you're Sandoval that's a bad slider though that's a mistake slider by Murakami
0:38:15,Now the one to that is right three passes in the NBP these days. Yamamoto his first pitch ninety five miles an hour but off the outside.
0:38:30,He throws a very unique curve ball got that he knows a grip on it basically turning his wrist over how you talked about a day one of the things that he's doing.
0:38:45,one of the best ones in the game this is down and in ball two is the two time reigning Salomone award winner.
0:39:0,which is essentially the Cy Young for both leagues best pitcher in the professional leagues two and two that's a good splitter right there see see it more as a two seamer but the action is there and the drop
0:39:15,is there to pitch Thomas strikes out swinging that's nasty on him. A lot of misses up in the zone so for Sasaki the three.
0:39:30,Three runs allowed all in one swing Austin Barnes with a foul ball and out of this game Japan trailing three nothing and really not tested at all.
0:39:45,in this little baseball classic yet they have dominated Yamamoto
0:40:0,big chopper to third fair ball long throw got him let's go back down to jp david since 2013 teams that had to make the trans-pacific flight
0:40:15,"after pool player the second round have lost every single semifinal, including Team Japan in 2013 and again in 27. Low offense was a huge concern for Team Japan."
0:40:30,to avoid a repeat here tonight a Rosarito takes a strike at ninety seven on the inside got so much you just can't you can hit all you want but it's just not the same.
0:40:45,Yeah it's a good point by both of you because it's not necessarily just the long travel and maybe the jet lag but because of the long travel you have to build in a couple of days of acclimation and those days can serve to
0:41:0,to ice an offense no matter how many practice swings you take how much batting practice just doesn't relate to real game speed pitching all to I remember I used to take thousands
0:41:15,I've seen dozens of swings in the offseason but the first time I would face a pitcher oh my goodness it was like I was learning how to walk all over again that one called a ball even though it could have been a strike it's three and one to a Rosarito.
0:41:30,the intensity it's just a lot different when it's a game speed the lights are on the players know it.
0:41:45,This is inside that's called for Time right there I Don't think there's anybody we have a lot of candidates in the u.s. Has had players who have loved this tournament we saw
0:42:0,pool play here in Miami just tremendous but I don't know if anybody's enjoyed it more than Randy Rosarito one to Alex Verdugo and I don't think it's seriously stay loose.
0:42:15,that's just him he has performed in the World Series in the playoffs in the World Baseball Classic. He does not allow the pressure of the moment to
0:42:30,It's a soft bouncer the second throw to first and play to JP for the Mexican manager Benji Hill to not only be here for the first time in the semifinals Mexico has never done this before
0:42:45,So to leave the Cactus League and come here close by the Grapefruit League and get a chance to see his kid how much sleep got to see his son. That's a lot of fun. You rarely get to see him too because he's in Arizona.
0:43:0,The sun is here for St. Lucie. Okamoto a high fly ball deep left field a Rosarito at the wall he leaves. Are you not entertained.
0:43:15,on Refolio this guy just
0:43:30,Proved to everybody that yeah he had the baseball. Wow what a catch. Line drive base hit right field. Good piece of hitting right there. Good swings here.
0:43:45,from Japan and you know he's done this a lot in this tournament. He'll come on he'll be signing autographs here. They're having a meeting on the mound during the game.
0:44:0,that's going to be a little bit of a change in the game. We'll be right back. First check. Make sure to have time to get this one side. Look at this. He does it during the game. World Baseball Classic. You get it all. He did it the other night. Why change.
0:44:15,ran out of time this is fun. Now get that runner at first one out. We don't really know if get that really fun it is.
0:44:30,first time up we're just not quite sure he can swing the bat like usual up in the order looming this the eighth place hitter some better swings against sound of all maybe a little more vulnerable. Yes there is a rain on today before the game.
0:44:45,"What do you got on Sasaki? He says, well, the only thing I got is that he's going to go home with a loss. Man, he tells you everything you need to know about the attitude. Right? They have all the confidence in the world."
0:45:0,of the world Satie was swagger right now. Even if he didn't get that swing right there on that slider that's a better slider. He's been missing at the top of the zone a lot. He was a hanging slider.
0:45:15,It's got to have died down. He's got to finish. Two and one here to the great shortstop.
0:45:30,He said he just he was not going to miss this period. Three one foul.
0:45:45,They aware of what's happening there. So here they are in the portion and I don't know how they feel playing in here right now. Oh but it looks like they know who goes substitution. There's a really good Round Ball candidate right here. Especially with this panky.
0:46:0,with his bottom hand there's definitely a lot more grip but that's open you want to stay hard with him if he's late stay hard it's a lot easier to contact rollover with a breaking ball if it's a breaking ball it's going to be a strikeout breaking ball
0:46:15,that's been working out for Mexico big pitch here three two runner goes and another ball fouled off to the left side. I would stay hard with him. That's that's kind of the go to pinky on his right hand heavily taped.
0:46:30,picked up hanging right out over the plate with it though three to no first.
0:46:45,Shimano dives back safely it's running again three to he goes and it's slashed foul again. Another fastball.
0:47:0,and the ball continues to pound the strike zone. But you're also thinking about OK if I want to strike out here the change up is the pit is the play closest that it looks to a fastball. There's no spinning ball.
0:47:15,I would think he'll stay hard continue to stay hard here. The pitch of the at bat coming but first another throw to first if you can get the swing and miss a good jump against the lefty side of all.
0:47:30,So this is it's not like this is a straight straight to him on it goes again and it is up and in for he walked in what a great way to end the game.
0:47:45,And I think that's going to be the final pitch that Patrick Sandoval throws Maki right handed hitter against Rikishi two on one out.
0:48:0,down and then he got new bar Kondo and Ohtani looming after this first pitch and the breaking ball Barnes dropped it after the swing and miss no problem.
0:48:15,He's with a good slider really got some good breaking balls a lot of good bite on the sweeper
0:48:30,There's a lot of movement down with this sinker that's the pitch right there and that sweeper it just looks like a fastball and then it go back to the sweeper you can go down under with the two seamer he's in a hole low and Maki.
0:48:45,to on the ground the shortstop not hit hard Trejo's plays to first and he just got it. Showed off a really good arm. That's big out. Runners did advance Yama.
0:49:0,Yamada to third get that to second and now the leadoff hitter has become such a big star in Japan Southern California kid playing for team
0:49:15,Japan takes a breaking ball for a strike balls but now he goes to work with the sweeper onto that back foot and it makes it look like a fastball and then it just dives into.
0:49:30,especially the left handers
0:49:45,he's come out of out of that
0:50:0,with really good control of all his pitches he's been in so many big games in his young career with Houston 0 2 just testing the waters right there with.
0:50:15,pitch again he's thrown it twice we'll take the slider the sweepers a good one here the top of the zone is really good as well one to bounce that slider and a great job by Austin brought to the two and two.
0:50:30,and nobody got to get a pitch up in the zone.
0:50:45,He's seeing him good. The approach stays the same. Gotta be up. Gotta be up.
0:51:0,Here we go full count three and to the pitch is Paul for he walked in that's a really good at bat from being 0 2 to a walk
0:51:15,He's had an excellent tournament has a base hit tonight against the starter side of all. Well he started every hitter with breaking ball. Would he do it here first pitch.
0:51:30,And that one is driven to left field a Rosarito back a Rosarito at the wall to make the catch Adam Jones himself the king of great WBC catches says Jones is no longer the man it's Randy Rosarito.
0:51:45,Moreno when it comes to great catches in this event. OK he said it. That's it. He says it. Hard to dispute. Joey Manessis on the ground down to a couple of knees.
0:52:0,And a throw to first for out number one. It's gone. It's just gone Mexico's way. The whole time. I mean every hard hit ball that Japan's hit has been right at somebody. Every bloop that Mexico's hit.
0:52:15,hit has dropped and then well you've got the good pitching as well. Yeah from Sandoval and the great catches from that guy didn't have time to sign any autographs after the second one.
0:52:30,had to come back in the dugout. He's still having fun. He is just totally relishing this chance to play.
0:52:45,here in this event there's a strike and it's one of two has become his adopted home country and you can just tell by the way he plays here how much pride he has taken in that.
0:53:0,How much he cares about Tellez goes down swinging nasty the ace of the pitching staff and Yamamoto wears number 18 kind of like in soccer wearing number 10.
0:53:15,The best player on the team is the number of distinction for the first time he had 18 and many of the other great Japanese pitchers over the years have worn it.
0:53:30,of the year on himself in a fastball count here. What do you get when it is two for two.
0:53:45,with a run scored one baby cutter right there. That's a good pitch down in a way. Fred has had two of those five hits against Roki Sasaki and he made Sasaki.
0:54:0,Maybe set the stage for his teammate who hit the three run homer after he pops this one up see if it's playable first base side foul ground it is four out number three.
0:54:15,hitters it's just different with Ohtani I haven't seen that just clobbered a line drive his last time up but it was caught.
0:54:30,So he's over to this one a big topper and a little kick foul it's going to talk to the manager the coaches they're not messing with this guy let him do his thing.
0:54:45,He lines that one in the left field and that's going to be a hit for Ohtani. From one star to another Rosarito picks it up and Ohtani tried in the same division. American League West and.
0:55:0,and not the best of it. All one. On Sataka Yoshi swings line drive singles each time up he's eight for 17 in this world baseball classic.
0:55:15,To him the attack I've got this you know he's got a good change up though he's still eager to be somebody just a quicker
0:55:30,for a lot of good swings so far though nothing to show for it still down three nothing.
0:55:45,spot in the championship game on the line and a little squib shot foul. That's a good change up right there. So now it's 2-2 let's go down to JP. What a great horn section in left field here at Lone Depot Park wherever Sam
0:56:0,Samurai Japan travels their fans go with them and there is a specific anthem that all those loyal supporters know for every single player in the lineup and here they are singing their song for Yoshida with some gusto.
0:56:15,two to two big chopper the first backhand by Manassas gets the out of second to throw the first down in time. Good thing he put on the eyeball.
0:56:30,You never know when you need it. So now we're coming over to and he struck out twice. The first pitch here he is just out of sorts of the play. They've done a good job on him.
0:56:45,anything you hit either gets caught or if you get a good pitch to hit you'll miss it.
0:57:0,the homerun Yes that was a swing
0:57:15,Really count on in the middle of this lineup. It's been a tough night for him to down.
0:57:30,Yamamoto who has had some good swings including the one last time.
0:57:45,The dugout for Mexico.
0:58:0,State instead of three 0
0:58:15,So it's to one big opening on the right side of the infield way outside with a breaking ball not close to 30 or more home runs for five straight years in Japan he takes.
0:58:30,to the ball. That's a good bad. I want to talk about how intense this inning is getting. The pitcher is pitching running on the bench trying to preserve their energy. Now a motor has got the glove just in case.
0:58:45,He's a third out but he's watching he wants to top step his teammate he's staying loose but he's he's in the top step making sure that he this is the manager and she he'll coming out to talk to her t.d. I don't know that this is this.
0:59:0,early pitching change coming. This is I want to look into your eyes and I want to know what you've got. Can you get one more guy out for me. Very stressful situation came in in a stressful situation. This is just him letting him know.
0:59:15,We live and die with you I need your best right here it's in the world baseball.
0:59:30,Classic for him not a big power hitter trying to keep the rally going to want to out takes a strike. That's a good fastball right there. You know he's been going soft especially with runners in scoring position right there changing it up.
0:59:45,up on him one ball one strike. He's having a hard time right now with that pitch.
1:0:0,That's beautiful in it out over the plate stylish hitter ball pop foul back out of play fastball on his hands. I was a good pitch right there. How you can score.
1:0:15,you can beat him up you can slow him down you can do a lot of things with him one to just he's missing big with that pitch right now that's a ball out of the hand that's.
1:0:30,Got to slow it down with that left shoulder you can go back in there if you want big pitch here action. It's 2 2 so many women throw many big pitchers number five
1:0:45,He tried he tried to go back in there he just rushed it a little bit.
1:1:0,homers the lead can get to head
1:1:15,There they go three to his ball for he tried that breaking ball right now he just does not have a feel for that pitch the bases are loaded.
1:1:30,L'Olympique de Marseille est le plus grand stade de la Ligue des Nations. L'Olympique de Marseille est le plus grand stade de la Ligue des Nations.
1:1:45,so another opportunity third inning in a row where Japan another big opportunity though for Suzuki again down with a broken finger
1:2:0,Trying to come through he takes inside ball one. He worked it really at bat and finally drew a walk his last time up. He saw a lot of fastballs in the prior at bat. He was late on everything.
1:2:15,So a fastball there but it missed one of the bases loaded two down and a strike that's a good change up and more than not.
1:2:30,That one is hit down the left field line a Rosarito on the move. The Rosarito will get there and make the. It's three nothing thanks to the guy at the plate Luis Urias swings the first pitch fastball here. Mitchell.
1:2:45,You really can tell that the five days have been a test for them. And I agree with you but sometimes in this sport even good at bats don't get rewarded.
1:3:0,this time for Rios and Japan has had so early on the offense for Japan just wasn't there. Last few innings a lot of loud contact. He's having fun huh? Not one ounce of stress.
1:3:15,one out here in the seven perfect pitch from Yamamoto who's been impressive since coming in the game. Talk about it. It's just.
1:3:30,it's it's really cool to see these are the best players in the world that was we're just playing practice games getting ready for the games that really count. Yeah but they've been so sharp.
1:3:45,It feels like they're playing in the middle of July right now and it feels like October clean baseball 0 2 off the outside hitters.
1:4:0,that's making you work one to Alan Trejo has gone from 0 2 to 2 and 2.
1:4:15,They've gone for the most part away from him there's no need to leak only to think inside think if it's inside it's just more of a surprise.
1:4:30,surprise pitch they're trying. Here we go set that target in two two and he was ready for it pulled it down the left field line. That is a foul ball. Impressive. It's right.
1:4:45,balls for here and now another two two to trade off from Yamamoto Rocks back breaking ball slowly coming backlear that very back receiver is going to
1:5:0,It is a foul ball and a good decision. Very good decision right there or a commie left a lot of guys on base.
1:5:15,time finally Yamamoto was in the money and weighs only 24 years old. He would be in trouble with a new pitch clock.
1:5:30,He would have to pick up the pace to to the dirt and very likely that at the end of this baseball season twenty twenty four we're likely going to see this guy.
1:5:45,Major League Baseball a little teaser here tonight 3 2 Trejo takes one for Wow. Very good at that right there.
1:6:0,I just think for Yamamoto he just didn't execute he was disgusted with himself or Mexico they haven't had a hit since the three run homer back in the fourth inning it's really been an amazing game.
1:6:15,here in the dirt good block by the catcher Kai very good block right there going going back to Morakami the third baseman.
1:6:30,definitely going to get at least one more at bat here in this game one pitch that went off the inside. So Yamamoto after getting ahead of now with.
1:6:45,I think there will be some movement in the bullpen seventh innings are very important and you don't want to Rosario to face him in a tight situation if he's still as erratic right now he's erratic that one is.
1:7:0,this badly three and he was working with a much where he's slowed it down but has no feel it doesn't look like they're kind of.
1:7:15,just waiting for the call 3 and 0 to Alec Thomas that's a strike.
1:7:30,The bottom part of the order Yamamoto does not want to be giving away free base runners already rally start when you turn over the lineup.
1:7:45,Here's the three one runner going and it's a check swing foul. So Thomas tried to hold up Trejo was off and. Right hander. Starting to get loose in the bullpen.
1:8:0,not running foul to the backstop
1:8:15,This time Trejo does run it swung on and hit foul Thomas again just a little foul ball where I got to tell you there's a huge gap in right center.
1:8:30,I mean anything gets hit into the outfield there's a lot of speed on the bases and that guy hitting right now it's got a lot of speed as well big outfield here
1:8:45,with a split three to Trejo runs it is swung on and missed. Here comes the throw the.
1:9:0,"Somehow Trejo got around the tag, who's going swimming? Well, Trejo's going swimming. What a swim move right there. I think they're going to... He might be right, but if it's me making the call..."
1:9:15,"What a what a cool move though, huh? It was a great effort by right there Wow So it's either out number three if they overturn the call and"
1:9:30,The side is retired. Randy Rosarena part of Team Mexico stealing the show so far but still nine outs to go to get into the championship game against the United States. Ball one from Orchidi and a pitcher friendly strike there.
1:9:45,That's one and one it's got to happen right now at least one run guy pushes a button foul. Just not a great hitter. Night place hitter came in after they used.
1:10:0,Fernandez won by two struck him out swinging as a good fastball in this zone right there.
1:10:15,Isn't that pretty cool. He's an E.S. on his little league cap. El Segundo. California native. His mom. Who grew up in Japan. His mom's just outside Tokyo. And he is the first player not born in Japan.
1:10:30,for Japan to represent this team he drives this one toward the gap in left center a Rosa Reina gets to another one hit it somewhere else. And that one by his standards is pretty routine still though a hard hit.
1:10:45,baseball and tough luck for Japan not as easy as people may think you've got the lights coming you've got the left hander who hit it that ball sliding from you or into you.
1:11:0,one one to Kondo takes low and that ball was one hundred and five miles off the mound contact in this game has almost always come from Japan and yet they're down three nothing foul to the backstop.
1:11:15,He got Ohtani waiting on deck it's the seventh inning have not been able to find any spots out there against this defense one two.
1:11:30,the most stressful part of this game is that right now we need seven more now it is lined up in the leaping attempt of a real base hit.
1:11:45,So Kondo he's hit the ball hard three times Japan even though Tony's not going to face Orchidi just to get their great slugger up with somebody on base that at bat Right after their father Ramon senior a schoolteacher
1:12:0,tonight face maybe the world's greatest player Shohei Ohtani could be his final at bat in this game. We'll see with two outs left against left and a fastball and a strikeout.
1:12:15,at ninety five but a little bit high you're going to get a fastball by Ohtani better be a good one. It better be big moment Romero twenty six years old.
1:12:30,field because he's so fearsome. Then the cleanup hitter comes up as the tying run and if you're the outfielders right now you're playing.
1:12:45,as deep as possible you're playing kind of no doubles man to a slider again I don't think Otani is really seeing that pitch all that well for anything to change here for your Mexico.
1:13:0,So a 3 0 count to a tiny that is a strong gutsy very gutsy. Yeah I don't know if maybe.
1:13:15,trio you feel like in a three nothing game he's going to be taking maybe he won't be taking here automatically.
1:13:30,And now Yoshida comes up as the tying run. That's a good at bat. Once again. We talked about the urgency. Masataka Yoshida has two hits tonight. Two for three.
1:13:45,Romero and a good swing foul straight back but a good fastball right there I mean that pitch needed to be more in he couldn't afford to be over the plate with that pitch.
1:14:0,pitch getting ready to start his major league journey. But first things first semifinals of the World Baseball Classic 0 1 off the inside.
1:14:15,back in and this time Yoshida didn't swing what I see from Yoshida he's been able to back up the baseball very well
1:14:30,Romero went soft on it wanted to
1:14:45,seventh inning the 1 2 2 and 2
1:15:0,Yoshida hasn't really gone out of the strike zone. They've tried. He's been pretty good with it.
1:15:15,Now the two to it is hit high and deep down the right field line toward the corner it is gone up the foul pole. Tie game.
1:15:30,today.
1:15:45,was put to test. They're alive! What a moment! What a moment for Yoshida! Wow!
1:16:0,That's a guy who's hit a walk off home run in the Japan Series the equivalent of the World Series just last year.
1:16:15,seventh inning Japan's championship hopes are alive and they're in lies so tiny is and he's great.
1:16:30,great you walk in and the time run comes up I was getting ready to say the same thing. Yeah. Show here right there led to that.
1:16:45,This is more comedy. More comedy. But you've got to be so careful with changeups to lefties because it just runs into their barrels.
1:17:0,if you're full it just continues to run into it even if that's a one handed home run right there the RBI is 13.
1:17:15,that's a new record in the history of the world baseball classic I've never seen show it is animated.
1:17:30,"Yeah, I don't see how much it means to him. Can you imagine Tokyo right now? It's not Gorichiwa anymore."
1:17:45,They're hoping at some point here this evening Convent one to two and a Papa Murakami third base side it will be caught Paredes has a whole new ball game.
1:18:0,And Mexico has to feel a little. You got the ninth place hitter Austin Barnes and then the top of the order coming up again. Yamamoto still in the game. Strike it's over to the fastball right.
1:18:15,there only 45 pitches for Yamamoto who is a starter.
1:18:30,to the Barnes stellar game for him defensively now.
1:18:45,Don't try to do it at the plate one out and he takes a strike. The fastball right there down in the way it touched the day they pitched on a very tough.
1:19:0,right field going back quickly and over the head of Condo up against the wall of Rosarito in the second with a one out double.
1:19:15,for Rosarito first hit a lot by Yamamoto and the go ahead run is in scoring position for Alex Verdugo.
1:19:30,pitch. White left center field that's going to be a hit and Mexico is going to go back ahead. Rosarito is in the score Verdugo with a double.
1:19:45,It's four to three.
1:20:0,Wow it's a fastball up in the zone another guy they pitch very tough but how clutch has he been who hit the homerun to tie the game for two in a row.
1:20:15,Verdugo Red Sox outfielder puts Mexico back ahead Duran Red Sox outfielder runs for Verdugo. They have a lot of outfielders in Boston and sure do what a great problem to have. Joy Vanessa is a chance.
1:20:30,to add to the lead this would be huge. Thanks to that Bush first pitch not close.
1:20:45,He had in the pool play. They were both on fastballs.
1:21:0,Mexico an extra run would be just massive.
1:21:15,The bat broke his back.
1:21:30,Chris Dientzche represents PanA here in Philadelphia.
1:21:45,Now pick up play and he got back
1:22:0,And the lead's a little shorter now after that pick off. The one one on the ground into the whole base hit the ran out of weight though so he'll go to third and stop.
1:22:15,Yeah I think Japan's going into the bullpen. Yamamoto. The greatest pitcher in Japan is coming out of this game after three consecutive strikes. He's better than Elon Musk.
1:22:30,consecutive hits Mexican only be six outs away from a spot in the championship game. Already have gone back ahead. You got a combo on the bases Vanessa's at first and the hitter tell us either one at first base.
1:22:45,base with the runner on first base they've moved the second baseman over to try to plug some of that hole but you're right to tell us first pitch swinging foul down the left field line.
1:23:0,The worst thing that can happen here is a strike is a is a double play it's the worst thing
1:23:15,is keeping the ball rolling
1:23:30,Patrick huge spot for this young
1:23:45,Here's his 0 1 on the pinch runner at third Vanessa said first.
1:24:0,first oh to Manassas runs and the pitch is taken for a ball. Thanks to the play right there. Yeah that changes everything. Now the infield has to come in. You have no double play possibility. Now Japan trying to cut down Duran.
1:24:15,home on a ground ball what an
1:24:30,right now another image we've just seen it over and over again how much these games beat to these guys who play thing into these games.
1:24:45,two for three it's been a huge part of the Mexican offense second and third two outs pitcher friendly strike their
1:25:0,is he likes the ball at him. When Walcott as you say you can have a little bit of a short fuse the umpire is barking right back at Benji Hill the manager.
1:25:15,back out there to that spot and missed that's where you want to go.
1:25:30,here's the one one breaking ball
1:25:45,they're watching they're using a lot of arms out of the bullpen for Mexico and for Japan the U.S. team got tested with the back-to-back quarterfinal semi-final
1:26:0,But once they won those two games now they may have an advantage for the championship. Who will they play Mexico or Japan.
1:26:15,the field Duran in here comes Meneses the throw the tag got him at the plate. But a runs batted in. I am tight and it hit him.
1:26:30,So Okamoto power hitter first pit a good slider just a two pitch guy fastball slider that's what you're going to see seen in two games right there three strikeouts just one run and two innings big first baseman.
1:26:45,So they'll get some more speed on the bases down two runs and down to their final six outs. We said the same thing last inning. You're up to and you walk. Ohtani and you put the tying run at the plate.
1:27:0,over there at first Yamada the hitter and the dirt for Cruz
1:27:15,for Duran was the runner for Verdugo so he takes over and the other part of this for Japan Yamada is the seventh place hitter you know they've done a
1:27:30,That's a good job though getting base runners they have. That's a good writing fastball right there that's a zip on it.
1:27:45,down here in Yankee Stadium.
1:28:0,"This game is a long way from over. Oh, you know it. Now the small ball. And I think it's shown tonight, JP, because he's got two hits and a walk. He's had good at-bats all game long. Oh, sacrificing time. Yeah, because you've got the guy who's got the broken fist."
1:28:15,He's already showing that he's going to square around now. That doesn't mean it's not possible that he could pull the bat back and try to chop one pass to draw it in field.
1:28:30,the situation like this where you're going to go everybody's got to go here let's just calm down.
1:28:45,not just the pitcher this is for the pitcher and that everybody's got to talk in this meeting right now talk to Manassas you tell him OK you're crashing Cruz you've got the third base side Trejo you've got to be here everybody's got a job to do.
1:29:0,Meanwhile lurking. Oh yeah what a game. It was three nothing.
1:29:15,Mexico after the Orias home run all the way into the bottom of the seventh and a two hour rally the three run homer to tie the game Mexico goes back ahead now Japan threatening again
1:29:30,showing but here Cruz they'll put the wheel play on and the pitch is taken high. Trejo came sprinting over to third so that we'll play it was basically done to get the out of third.
1:29:45,It would have been a double play third to first that's the play doesn't really happen. Yeah you're right. And remember you get the pinch runner at second not going to who's got pretty good speed out 
1:30:0,I always like to tell it's a dicey play but I always like to tell it would have been ball three.
1:30:15,foul to a two you're going to file it off. I would think the bun is still on here. You've got to trust your guy in getting the bun down.
1:30:30,Maybe part of that is just that finger injury for this short stop. To do he's showing but got to get it down he butts and he does get it down. That's his will look but take the.
1:30:45,the first and almost a disaster Rios came over to cover in the decision there the speed on the bases help for Japan.
1:31:0,they're looking for. We're going to get another pitch hitter Taka. Yamakawa. Is at the plate. Third different hitter in this stretch now.
1:31:15,first spot in the lineup tonight in the dirt and it kicks up off of Yamakawa his face what a block it was for Nakano to score from third.
1:31:30,"that one is driven to left field but Rosarena will make the catch Kockanoe tags, he'll come in to score the throw goes to third it's a one-run game Rosarena"
1:31:45,of the year. Got the job done. Got the run in. And we know who's going to get Mexico added on to their. We have had an action packed late innings tonight.
1:32:0,another meeting which means we're going to have a new pitcher here with the left handed hitters left in scoring position two down ball one not close.
1:32:15,with Ray is his knock is he's got a big arm but he's got to be able to control it.
1:32:30,of his last time up the Chicago
1:32:45,and foul Ray's throwing that four seam foul right at the last second Mexico needs an out. Japan needs it.
1:33:0,to hit to one off the inside three and one for new bar right now it's got to start kind of middle way for you to go on on day.
1:33:15,Jack Kenske condos hit one line drive after another in this game and then of course got to pull him three one.
1:33:30,"He pulled it foul. Look out. I think for Nubar, too, even with three... Gotta make sure you get a strike, though. That's first. Then after..."
1:33:45,is the approach Sonny California kid been dreaming about playing for Japan since he was 12 years old three to he takes a ball.
1:34:0,So he draws the walk on score. Two on two out Ohtani now in the on deck circle.
1:34:15,it's a strike 97 on the outside that's tough because Newport tells you it's a ball that's cutting and all of a sudden it's got right and gets questioned
1:34:30,runner really yeah one follow the way. Oh man he's late to one man
1:34:45,attended on Saturday night.
1:35:0,Rerun over the big swing of the night for Mexico against Ota. Wow. Well should have been a strike but the catcher dropped it. He's just into you know one thing about Ty say.
1:35:15,Has a heavy fastball good splitter. I go to right and number one. Talked about all those fastball splitter I mean guy like all rookies and say.
1:35:30,games last year fly ball shallow left falling and it'll be back to the infield the shortstop Gander. So two quick outs.
1:35:45,in pacing looming waiting he's going to lead off in the bottom of another pitch dropped but called a strike and I think for Ohtani though you know that's.
1:36:0,you're kind of always lurking in the back of your head you don't go chase the homerun you just get a good pitch to hit that leads to a homerun 0 2 and it's really it's setting up almost like a Barry Bonds situation it's a one run game do you.
1:36:15,him too carefully he's one of the fastest players in the game and the tying run as a board to start the inning. Yeah. So that's that's the problem right there is you've got so many variables but for Tony is about trying to fastball.
1:36:30,they're going over it right now and then all you start doing is thinking OK visualizing what am I going to get first pitch where are the percentages what am I going to do with it.
1:36:45,in the game that would hit him. So he got ahead of Alex Thomas and couldn't put him away.
1:37:0,Takes the hat off gives a little bow to Alec Thomas just to acknowledge. To paint right now with the adrenaline and it hurts a little bit but. Tomorrow her.
1:37:15,Tomas hoping he has to play through some pain tomorrow. Mexico is three outs away from a spot in the championship game against the United States. No matter what it's going to be a scene. Oh yeah.
1:37:30,Thomas's board he's got if he's running OK he's got great speed
1:37:45,to knock the ball but not for three tonight the Dodgers catcher pulls that one foul.
1:38:0,here We'd change the Tommy
1:38:15,find a way to get Alec Thomas home. Oh big time to be freed up to just go after him. That one dropped again another close pitch man. Oshiro having a really hard time.
1:38:30,a little late with his timing of the gloves a lot of times you
1:38:45,You said that target but if you're not ready for the pitch to come and you're dropping your target to get ready for the ball to come to you you're late with it very hard to come back with that especially with the late movement right now.
1:39:0,here in a one to count here's the pitch Thomas runs swung on and missed strike three.
1:39:15,Ohtani tonight has lined out single walked after striking out looking all the way back to the first inning. So here we go. Bottom of the ninth guy goes first pitch Ohtani reps a base hit in the right center field.
1:39:30,into the gap. Cut off by Thomas in center field Ohtani steps in second with a lead off double.
1:39:45,I was a preset determined swing. Masataka Yoshida who hit the home run to tie the game his last time up. He could win it with a home run here.
1:40:0,with a fastball he's hit two
1:40:15,I've just been impressed with the way he can control the strike at second.
1:40:30,He does such a good feel like you're behind the baseball. He does such a good job with that. You would think take.
1:40:45,three oh but he's seen the ball so well here's the pitch it is a
1:41:0,right the three one very high
1:41:15,Well it seems inconceivable the guy who just won the triple crown in Japan. V.P. that you would even consider asking him to give himself a chance to win the World Series.
1:41:30,up but the way the winning run aboard with nobody out and the manager wants to talk and he might be thinking to say I mean look in a different spot I don't think it would even be possible but.
1:41:45,Murakami just has not looked you know it's fascinating the
1:42:0,The big slugger stands in two on nobody out looking very hitterish at the plate the pitch he fouls it off to the left out of play. That's a good swing.
1:42:15,right there. He'll be right here. Me too. You've got to trust your guy. Two-time MVP. He's been thinking about this moment for six years now. He's too good. Too good. Even if he hasn't looked great tonight.
1:42:30,You've got to trust it. Good speed on the bases with nobody out the 0 1 is in the dirt and he took that. It's nice softer take right there.
1:42:45,That's as much we talked a lot of times with him in the front foot how he's leaning To feel the weight of his front foot. That was a lot smoother a lot softer So gotta win this count
1:43:0,A good change of count. Yoko's got a good one. He goes looks back at Ohtani the pitch is hit to left center field. Hit very well and it is off the wall.
1:43:15,"third right behind him, scoring the winning run. Gohul spilled their guts out on the field."
