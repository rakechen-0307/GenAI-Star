start,transcript
40:0,one on one like that one right there that that splitter had no bite down on it just kind of stayed true. Verdugo shaking his head like man.
40:15,Off the inside. Big count here.
40:30,Staying with it. Yeah. He's staying with it especially later in the game. He's got a good really good feel for it. He's got a good feel for it.
40:45,usually when he's got good feel for it like that early on he will continue to have good feel for it later on in the game and he'll come reliable become his pitch that he goes to in key spots that he wants to win the count on said one to.
41:0,And he struck him out just never deviated. We know he hit that fastball Verdugo to left center on a bat earlier in his first at bat.
41:15,that Saki has definitely made the adjustment saying no no we're not going to give you the fastball anymore we're just going to give you all the splits. Oh he showed those numbers early in the game about Verdugo and how well he hits high velocity and he's one of the better high velocity hitters.
41:30,in the big leagues and he may not see many more fastballs tonight one out for Joey Vanessa's there's a fastball.
41:45,I'm seeing right now with Sasaki his adjustment periods right now and he read a lot of these hitters in the first time through. This is to left field.
42:0,Yoshida catches it on the edge of the warning track two down just a hair off the end of the bat from Manassas right there got a good breaking ball split and hung
42:15,I think Manassas is going back back saying man I just missed that man I just missed it just a little bit more.
42:30,They hit two home runs against Team USA and SS did in pool play. Rodney Tellez. It's fair to say.
42:45,That's splitters a dandy and now he's he's mixing and matching now right over top the splitter.
43:0,to cover up in the zone at 102 you can cover the split down under.
43:15,and ninety one ninety two he's in a pickle right here big hole tell us that's the time.
43:30,the 0 2 on the ground and nobody's there at third he beats the shift with a ground ball
43:45,"Well, that's a really good two-strike approach right there, and that's where it starts. It starts at the top of the zone. Look how, look how he hits this. Just gets on top of it, doesn't try to do too much. Too heavy."
44:0,and finish you know what I love about this and just puts his foot down there's no there's no leg kick involved it's just hey I'm going to pick right here I'm going to try to get a good pitch and just put some food on it and hopefully I'm lucky that was.
44:15,one oh two that fastball he's a big league hitters though nowadays they're seeing a hundred lot. Zacharias who had a base hit his first time up comes up for the second time.
44:30,and just a little bit I as catcher thought that was a strike Benji Hill a manager for Mexico really.
44:45,likes this player strike it's 1 and 1 and a really good year for the Rays last year.
45:0,So far these one one counts have been soft operators as in two fastballs you got the splitter there one and two.
45:15,The problem with the 1 1 counts man you know he's gone soft with him but you just respect the fastball so much you had your chance early on in this advent now you're in a little bit of a hole could be action pitch here
45:30,Runner at first two down the one two just stays alive against the splitter. Your parade is here you've got to pick and choose your battle right. You got to pick and choose which
45:45,to protect and what velocity you're going to protect more than now you protect three quarters of the way outside of the plate. The zone's got to be up
46:0,that's a guy that's showing me he wants to make sure he gets something up in the zone you're also deceptive to the heater up the riding heater.
46:15,A lot of times we're seeing nowadays in the big leagues finished right handers off. Get the bright nail polish to make for easier visuals on the catcher signals to two on the ground.
46:30,ground foul by third right on right he's operating as this is to a batch where he has really hung in there against.
46:45,right hander he's seen a lot of pitches down in this game big spot for the Hermosillos Parady's top of the ninth in
47:0,two to the it's a little pop up behind third and it's going to fall.
47:15,for a commie picked it up off the bounce so Saki came over to cover so that forced tell us to stop at second but back to back two out hits on a great at bat though by Paredes the more the at bat went on the better he felt saw that forcing.
47:30,right there but it was up in the zone. Dave I think that's where he was looking the whole way out. Everything had to be up in the zone. Gave himself a shot. Got lucky. They're in a pickle now of your team.
47:45,that's been going on for a couple of weeks. It's a little bit of a stressful situation. First and second two outs the team that gets base hits with two outs more than not becomes the team that wins the game. Big moment here. Luis Urias he had a hit.
48:0,In his first at bat he hit the ball that came right back to Suzuki and hit him in the stomach. Just a little late that pitch was right down the middle but a.
48:15,at 100 miles an hour he's seen the baseball good but just a little late he's got a short enough one thing to keep in mind.
48:30,and I can tell as the lead runner does not have a lot of speed they said to the outfield not guaranteed that he could score one.
48:45,field.
49:0,200 what a moment.
49:15,"Wow! Hanging splitter, Dave. He got the hanging splitter, Dave."
49:30,for a base hit and the first time back hanging splitter again for a homer biggest hit of his young career shaheo tani almost like okay we got
49:45,got our hands full this Mexican team has played great baseball this play just never died and never and never had the bite.
50:0,A little bleeder a little blue and then a blast to strike its own too many times in the dugout you're saying two bloops and a blast two bloops and a blast a bloop and a blast.
50:15,That's exactly what Mexico got right there two outs nobody on the ground ball to beat the shift nobody was a third old pop up broken back pop up and then Luis Rios to our hands.
50:30,so important in tournament play look at him oh he knows it no doubter that only had three hits.
50:45,It's all tournament until tonight Saki misses up in a way wanted to all of a sudden now he started this ending at forty four pitches.
51:0,six up to sixty three but speaking of three how about the three.
51:15,run two out rally capped off by Luis Orias his first world baseball classic homerun makes it three nothing Mexico.
51:30,Well I'm not sure anybody really saw that coming Mexico two outs bases empty and a couple little soft hit balls that found a home out there and then Louisa Rios with the hardest hit ball of the game.
51:45,And it's three nothing Mexico with the way Patrick Sandoval is pitching he's faced the minimum through three innings top of the order Lars Newt Barr and team Japan's got some work to do. They sure do.
52:0,three games strike one three Series with the nickname Rachel or he's come up. Huge bar struck out.
52:15,And his first at bat hits big bouncer on the first base side foul. So he falls behind in the count 0 and 2. Does have the bullpen working.
52:30,along he comes up to the plate throws third base. It will finish sitting in the state of our best game of the year wearing the distinguished number 18 out of the bullpen.
52:45,success and numbers the most accomplished pitcher right now in Japan right into the defense Trejo throws him out.
53:0,I think if you're Sandoval right now you just want to get a zero you got all the momentum in the world you want to get back out there and let your team hit you want to continue to fight continue to punch he looks awesome
53:15,Sure has been right from the first pitch just mixing and matching changing speeds pinpoint location. That's been the key right there. Pinpoint location not really falling behind these hitters getting strike one.
53:30,A lot of soft pitches early on. It's a condo takes a ball inside this is a key hitter for Japan because you get a tiny on deck.
53:45,And you would love to get somebody on base for the great Shohei Ohtani.
54:0,impact delivery misses it's 2 and 0 I think a lot has to do with the guy who's behind who's on deck you want to be so perfect to the hitter prior to a tiny.
54:15,that you just lose it for a little bit as you know hey I can't have this guy get on first base it's a problem if the play by play guy notices the presence of the other team.
54:30,on deck hitter you can bet the pitcher does they know an inning or two prior really been tough to hit. Now those are last year's numbers but this lefty heavy lineup for Japan.
54:45,Japan good matchup for Patrick Sandoval that one on the ground in the right field base hit so Kondo comes through with the second hit of the game for Japan and there will be a base runner on.
55:0,for Ohtani that's a good piece of hitting right there for Sandoval and he wants that slider back that slider had no bite to it just kind of stayed up like a little cement mixer now you got problems with Shohei.
55:15,"And now Ohtani against his Angels teammate. And the first half back, Sandoval threw him a couple of change-ups. Kind of had Shohei a little bit of this sport of say."
55:30,"He was a little confused by it. Does he go back to that changeup or is it more of the fastball slider combo? One thing's for sure though, he's got to have pinpoint location with a very dangerous hitter."
55:45,Johnny displayed during batting practice today was breathtaking. Waiting for the first pitch from Sandoval and it's in the dirt.
56:0,that I did not know were possible to reach way up in there. He hit the he hit the video board on the fly when he pulled it a little more. He literally hit the video board on the fly and it hit the video board on the fly.
56:15,really hit it to the top of the second deck that was batting practice though. Sound of all taking a long time.
56:30,This was with a fastball to a no I'll tell you what they're in bad in practice it felt like there was the Beatles were in town and everybody was just admiring Shohei Ohtani strength as we see that ball hit the top.
56:45,on top of the TV that is so far. The longest home runs in the history of this ballpark. I mean he demolished in terms of the longest distances now that's in a game as it is.
57:0,It's different but. It was amazing. Tony high pop up third base side and foul.
57:15,to play the coolest part about batting practice was that it was him and Newport that were hitting there were the only ones hitting and everybody was just watching and when Shohei was done batting practices OK team we're ready we're ready.
57:30,He hit a homer to dead center he says we're good. Pack it up. Let's go. He got a standing ovation from all the fans here. Just a remarkably we haven't even talked about the pitching and the.
57:45,in the history of the game's ever done.
58:0,with a runner on base for being oh so careful he's had the front row seat for Tony's spectacular MLB success. I would be surprised if he sees another fastball here to change up.
58:15,three one and it's a strike. He's been very careful with him. That's a strike right there. A little backdoor slider.
58:30,looks like a front door slider like Tony was really fooled by that he throws a 3 1 and we see a 3 2 the changeups a plane here go to.
58:45,three two I like the change up. Three two. Tommy. Left center field it's going to be caught.
59:0,as you describe the crowd around batting practice was something unlike anything I'd ever seen.
59:15,"of people. I was in there somewhere, but it's remarkable, Dave and Yonder, my colleagues and I in the media who really do try to do a good job of being objective and keeping our even keel about things. I think a lot of us weren't."
59:30,We're supposed to be these cool customers. Well we weren't earlier today. There were a lot of our friends and colleagues who had the video camera the phone camera out. Just watching him put on the show.
59:45,in awe and I had my camera out said hold on a second I got to get a video of this and send it to all my family members and show my son one day. Hey this is show Hill Tony we hit that last ball that line out.
60:0,one hundred and ten miles an hour on one handed hit it one handed special to down Yoshida who has a base hit already slashes that one foul off to the left.
60:15,the count 0 2 the two way player at 14 years old saw him pitch was outstanding saw him hit a ball the other way for a homer and I knew Yep this guy is going to be a hitter.
60:30,going to be able to do both things even he could not have imagined the high level success because it's it's literally never happened before ever.
60:45,Oh to that one is like did the left base hit. So you know she does two for two condo heads to third the throw comes back in towards second.
61:0,and Japan is threatening just a couple of careless sliders right there up in the zone especially 0 to these pitches cannot be at the top of the zone when you got him basically dominated too good of a hitter for that though take.
61:15,look what they can get absolute rocket to left center for a base hit and this is a very big at bat for a big star in Japan to smile from Yoshida but Takamori Kamei has not been smiling much in this tournament.
61:30,He's the MVP two time MVP triple crown winner but four for 18 without a homerun what a spot this would be for him to break out.
61:45,Most home runs in a season in NBB history the great the all time greatest son of our all who hit fifty five home runs by Japanese born players. Morikami in twenty twenty two.
62:0,he tested the great shot of Haro 56 home runs to want to out.
62:15,that he's just leaking a little bit with his right shoulder. A lot of times you know we talk about the greats and like Nolan Aronado and Paul Goldschmidt they keep their head down they keep their heads still.
62:30,still a moment of contact he's kind of lifting up a little bit that's why he's getting a lot of foul balls that's why he's just a hair off the breaking balls got to simplify it and slow it down for him it's only the fourth inning they don't need to tie the game with one.
62:45,swing but a run would be a big answer for one that is a slider for a strike that's a good one right there that had bite.
63:0,year to a left handed hitter. He goes back to that slider. It's got to be a wasted pitch.
63:15,here in the second.
63:30,I was at the top of the zone a lot of the times I prefer if the umpire is going to call me on a ball up in the zone it's a breaking ball I never I never argued it I'm always arguing balls down in the zone but if you're Sandoval.
63:45,That's a bad slider though. That's a mistake slider that Murakami couldn't take advantage of.
64:0,three. This could not get the swing off a shutdown inning. We go to the fifth three nothing Mexico.
64:15,"for Patrick Sandoval. Quite a night for Patrick Sandoval, quite a reaction as well after the last half inning. Patrick has talked about the intensity and what it means to be a baseball fan."
64:30,for the Houston Astros in 2015. The same draft class as Alex Bregman and Team USA's Kyle Tucker. Now on the mound for Team USA is Kyle Tucker.
64:45,team japan yoshinobu yamamoto dave it's a really interesting strategy here and one that speaks to the somewhat dire circumstance for team japan they had hoped to have yamamoto available to them tomorrow for the final but they now realize
65:0,That's what an urgent game this semifinal has become. He is the established thank you JP the established. Ace of aces in the NBA these days Yamamoto his first pitch ninety five miles an hour.
65:15,But off the outside to Alec Thomas you know one thing he's a strike thrower for Seamer splitter curve cutter He throws a very unique curveball He's got that he knows a grip on it Basically
65:30,He's turning his wrist over and showing the backside of his hand to the batter and then he flicks it flicks it with his wrist very unique style. You talked about it Dave one of the best ones.
65:45,This is down and in ball to is the two time reigning Salomora Award winner which is essentially the Cy Young for both of them.
66:0,of the league's best pitcher in the professional leagues to a two that's a good splitter right there. A lot of time the hitters see see it more as a two seamer but the action is there and the drop is there.
66:15,to pitch Thomas strikes out swinging you go back to the fourth inning. Rookie Sasaki.
66:30,He who was impressive in a lot of ways but this is the ball that started the rally. Yeah I just felt he lost kind of the command there a lot of balls at the top of the zone. We know that hanging splitter was his biggest mistake but for the most part he had good.
66:45,man down in the zone and that inning it just unraveled on a lot of misses up in the zone for Sasaki the three runs allowed all in one swing Austin Barnes with a foul ball so he leaves six.
67:0,Sixty four pitches thrown four innings and out of this game Japan trailing three nothing and really not tested at all in this little baseball classic yet.
67:15,They have dominated in their five wins coming into tonight. Oh and to. Yamamoto.
67:30,"Big chopper to third, fair ball, long throw, got him. Let's go back down to JP. Dave, it's a really interesting trend in this tournament. Since 2013..."
67:45,teams that had to make the trans-pacific flight after a pool play or the second round have lost every single semifinal including Team Japan in 2013 and again in 2017 and in both of those semifinals
68:0,final losses a slow offense was a huge concern for Team Japan. Trying to avoid a repeat here tonight a Rosarito takes a strike at ninety seven on the inside got so much to deal with.
68:15,For me though for a hitter the five days off you just can't you can hit all you want but it's just not the same point by both of you because it's not necessarily.
68:30,I guess the long travel and maybe the jet lag. But because of the long travel you have to build in a couple of days of acclimation and those days can serve to ice an offense.
68:45,how many swings you take how much batting practice just doesn't relate to real game speed pitching all to I remember I used to take thousands of swings in the offseason but the first time I would face a pitcher.
69:0,Oh my goodness it was like I was learning how to walk all over again that one called a ball even though it could have been a strike it's three and one to a Rosarito the action the intensity the heartbeat it's just a lot different.
69:15,when it's a game speed the lights are on the players know it this is inside that's called for.
69:30,He was not real stressed out about the pressure this game before the game was he just having a good time. Why not.
69:45,"He's got his boots on, he's got his hat, signing some autographs, taking some pictures with some celebrities. CeCe and Adam Jones, I mean, that's a good time right there."
70:0,I don't think there's any but we have a lot of candidates in the U.S. has had players who have loved this tournament. We saw pool play here in Miami just tremendous but I don't know if anybody's enjoyed it more than Randy.
70:15,in Los Arenas one to Alex Verdugo and I don't think it's a total coincidence that a guy who can do that before a big game can you know not take himself too seriously stay loose. That's just him.
70:30,has performed in the World Series in the playoffs in the World Baseball Classic he does not allow the pressure of the moment to change him.
70:45,He's Pandora's Expert on Trouble in Phillies Bear Duga seen a steady diet of breaking balls
71:0,first in plenty of time for out number three. So Yamamoto comes into the game and retires Mexico without a run still no three nothing Japan trails.
71:15,A great family moment today for the Heal family. Team Mexico manager Benji Hill with his wife Carly and their son Matteo Hill who now.
71:30,is in spring training with the New York Mets so Benji was actually able to a couple days ago Dave make the drive from Miami to Port St. Lucie to be able to watch and have this time there there they are in Port St. Lucie so Benji of course works
71:45,for the Angels but wearing the Mets hat for his son on that particular day. So pretty cool experience. Thank you JP for the Mexican manager Benji Hill to not only be here for the first time in the semifinals Mexico has never made it this far in the world.
72:0,baseball classic but also to leave the Cactus League and come here close by the Grapefruit League and get a chance to see his kid how much sleep got to see his son that's a lot of fun and you rarely get to see him too because he's in Arizona.
72:15,Arizona Son is here for St. Lucie. Okamoto a high fly ball deep left field a Rosarito at the wall he leaves. He caught it.
72:30,Are you not entertained? Are you not entertained? This guy
72:45,He just proved to everybody that yeah he had the baseball. Wow what a catch. Are you not entertained.
73:0,cuts himself up sees the wall takes a peek and says OK here we go lift off. It's the only thing he hadn't done yet he's made a great catch now he's robbed a home run.
73:15,down he is something else. Look at Sandoval. Oh my goodness. Yeah look at me now. That's right.
73:30,Line drive base hit right field. Oh good piece of hitting right there. Good swings here from Japan. And. I think Yamada's. Theory was let me hit it to somebody other than that guy. Anywhere else.
73:45,else this was on Saturday. Save the game it did and he had kind of a similar pose but.
74:0,a little more spread out that's so cool they're gonna get up on that that's highway robbery I-95 robbery right here South Florida
74:15,in Florida he's just built for these big games and you know he's done this a lot in this tournament he'll come he'll be signing autographs here they're having a meeting on the mound.
74:30,"during the game. Yeah, he just checked to make sure to have time to get this one signed. Look at this. He does it during the game. World Baseball Classic. You get it all. He did it the other night. Why change?"
74:45,Sorry he ran out of time. This is fun.
75:0,I don't really know if get that really fun at his first time up we're just not quite sure he can swing the bat like usual. I mean for Japan these are huge because you get the top of the order looming this the eighth place hitter.
75:15,"Some better swings against Sandoval, maybe a little more vulnerable Yes, there was a rainout today before the game What do you got on Sasaki? He says, well, the only thing I got is that he's going to go home with a loss Man, he tells you everything you need to know about the attitude"
75:30,The Roads Arena and Mexico right they have all the confidence in the world. So team is some swagger right now.
75:45,"Even if he didn't get that swing right there on that slider, that's a better slider. He's been missing at the top of the zone a lot. Even that breaking ball that Rosarito was able to catch. That was a bad breaking ball."
76:0,He's got a hang slider he's got to have died down he's got to finish two and one here to the great shortstop.
76:15,hold up he did that has to hurt his fingers are chattering in there yeah he held
76:30,Oh my goodness the pain takes some toughness his manager said he just he was not going to miss this period.
76:45,safety of one three one foul
77:0,It's a really good ground ball candidate right here. Especially with this pinky with his bottom hand. There's definitely a lot more grip with the top hand. The problem is here is the rollover right. First base is open. You want to.
77:15,If he's late stay hard it's a lot easier to contact rollover with a breaking ball. It's a breaking ball is going to be a strikeout breaking ball. Penn working now for Mexico. Big pitch here three two runner goes and another one goes.
77:30,ball fouled off to the left side. I would stay hard with him. That's that's kind of the go to. It just it just can't be easy to hit.
77:45,Pinky on his right hand heavily taped up.
78:0,hanging right out over the plate with it though three to no throw to first and the amount of dives back safely bottom of the fifth.
78:15,Luis Rios is three run homer the difference in this game against the spectacular young starter Roki Sasaki Patrick Sandoval pitching so well and
78:30,Getting great support from his defense. See if your mother's running again three to. He goes and it's slashed foul again. Another fastball.
78:45,the number one I would think if he stays with it continues to pound the strike zone but you're also thinking about OK if I want to strike out here the change of
79:0,to play closest that it looks to a fastball. There's no spin involved. I would think he'll stay hard continue to stay hard here. Eighth pitch of the event coming. But first another throw to first.
79:15,and you could get the swing and miss I would think you'd have a pretty good chance for a strikeout and a throw for a double play because you might have just cannot get a very good jump against the lefty Sandoval.
79:30,So this is it's not like this is a straight steel situation. Yamada goes again.
79:45,again and it is up and in ball four. He walked in what a great job by Susquehanna to draw the wall. It really was. And I think that's going to be the final pitch that Patrick Sandoval throws.
80:0,in this game indeed there's the call to the bullpen Randy Rosarena helped him out but still the lead is in jeopardy pitching change we'll be back right after this.
80:15,Patrick Sandoval four and a third innings four hits six strikeouts only one walk I thought he pitched really really well but now with two on and only one out he gives the ball to his teammate Jose Orquidea out of the bullpen for Mexico he got the job done.
80:30,though sixty five pitches six strikeouts is the guy who kiddies he's pitched some big games for the Houston Astros they're going to need him from four innings to earn runs and five strikeouts they're going to need him.
80:45,and it's time to at least have a couple of good innings but we know that Mexico they got they got a really good bullpen he's got to be proud though in Sandoval.
81:0,Japan the ninth place hitter Nakamura a very good defensive catcher not known for his hitting and they're down three runs they've got an opportunity here they are using a pinch hitter this is Shugo Maki.
81:15,He's got two home runs already in this world baseball classic. He's showed plenty of power in the Central League.
81:30,sold Machi right handed hitter against Rikishi two on one out and then he got new bar Kondo and Ohtani looming after this
81:45,the pitch and the breaking ball Barnes dropped it after the swing and miss no problem.
82:0,He's with a good slider really got some good breaking balls a lot of good bite on the sweeper with a lot of movement down with this sinker that's the pitch right there and that sweeper it just looks like a fastball.
82:15,one that it dives on you right at the last second he made this pitch look how tight it is. Yeah more than not you're going to get those those swings right there especially if you're a right hander.
82:30,Now you've got windows right now you've got the fastball up in the zone you can go back to the sweeper you can go down under with the two seamer he's in a hole low and Maki to on the ground the shortstop not hit hard Trejo's plays to first.
82:45,and he just got it and showed off a really good arm to get the out. Oh goodness that was a good player right there. Understanding you had speed on all the bases not hit all that hard. Look how he sets his.
83:0,speed up right here the two step boom and then the strong throw oh man that's a dandy right there of a play runners did advance.
83:15,Yama Yamada to third Genda to second and now the leadoff hitter has become such a big star in Japan Cardinals outfielder Lars Neubauer.
83:30,Southern California kid playing for Team Japan and he takes a breaking ball for a strike. He's known to steal strikes first pitch with a strike.
83:45,with breaking balls but now he goes to work with the sweeper onto that back foot and it makes it look like a fastball and then it just dives into the back foot of a hitter especially the left handers good change.
84:0,such a big advantage this game
84:15,he's come out of out of that bullpen with really good control of all his pitches.
84:30,He's had so many big games in his young career with Houston 0 2 just testing the waters right there with new bar and see how disciplined he is. He's got another pitch.
84:45,He's got a lot of power in his hands and he's got a lot of control in his hands so that he can kind of see how discipline if he stays with him back to back change if it's not a bad pitch again he's thrown it twice we'll take the slider the sweepers a good one here top of the zone is really good as well
85:0,as well one to bounce that slider and a great job by Austin Barnes. This block right here. That's how it goes down the glove.
85:15,hit by. To the two and two. Nobody. Got to get a pitch up in the spirit.
85:30,zone he's seen him good he's not budging at all with anything down.
85:45,The approach stays the same. Gotta be up. Gotta be up.
86:0,Here we go full count three and two the pitch is Paul for he walked in. That's a really good at bat from being 0 2 to a walk that's exceptional right there.
86:15,"everybody knew but that's a professional bat right there. Your approach was very simple. Had to get something up. If not, I'm just not budging. Now what a great chance here for Japan."
86:30,and go who's had an excellent tournament has a base hit tonight against the starter Sandoval and comes up with the tying run at first base and two down an excellent speed out there for Japan. Well he started every hitter with breaking ball.
86:45,How do we do it here first pitch. And the great Ohtani on deck. And that one is driven to left field a Rosarito back a Rosarito at the wall to make the catch.
87:0,A pair of brilliant catches by Randy Rosarena bookending the fifth inning on an extraordinary night here in Little Havana. Look at this catch the celebration.
87:15,as well no penalty for excessive celebration there Dave Fleming and as he's running back in I have to share this changing of the guard Adam Jones himself the king of great WBC catches says Jones is no longer the man it's Randy
87:30,the Rosarito when it comes to great catches in this event. OK he said it. That's it. He says it's hard to dispute Joey Manessis on the ground down to a couple of knees.
87:45,number one made the play new catcher to who he takes over behind the plate for Japan.
88:0,Well I mean Japan has had some really good at Batsy's last couple innings and between the line drive caught off the bat of Ohtani by Alec Thomas the two outstanding pitchers in the league.
88:15,game being played by Rosa Reyna. It's gone it's just gone. He goes away the whole time and every hard hit ball as Japan's hit has been right at somebody every week that he goes hit has dropped.
88:30,And then well you got the good pitching as well. Yeah. From Sandoval. And the great catches from that guy. Didn't have time to sign any autographs after the second one had to come back in the dugout.
88:45,He's still having fun he is just totally relishing this chance to play.
89:0,this event there's a strike and it's one or two Randy Rosarito was was born in Cuba. That's where he grew up learned how to play ball. But Mexico has become his adopted.
89:15,home country and you can just tell by the way he plays here how much pride he has taken in that how much he cares about it. Tell us goes down swinging nasty. That's a good split right there.
89:30,Oh my goodness do this thing drop right here I love the tradition in Japan it's been going on for decades.
89:45,I think it started with the Tokyo Giants number 18. That's the ace of the pitching staff and Yamamoto wears number 18 kind of like in soccer wearing number 10.
90:0,the best player on the number of distinction remember when Daisuke came to MLB for the first time he had a team and many of the other great Japanese pitchers over the years.
90:15,probably not halfway through the first half. Most players'll know their teammates will be there. That's a good thing to come prepared in this first half. Warned it due in Albuquerque
90:30,here on himself in a fastball count here. What do you get when it is two for two with a run scored one baby cutter right there. That's a good pitch.
90:45,down in a way that is that two of those five hits against Roki Sasaki and he made Sasaki and those two at bats their 12 pitches.
91:0,Maybe set the stage for his teammate who hit the three run homer after he pops this one up see if it's playable first base side foul ground it is for out number three another one two three inning Ohtani coming up when we.
91:15,come back everyone impressed by the Ohtani show during batting practice including. Yeah my broadcast partner Yonder a lot so and that is actually from.
91:30,from your camera. OK not that part of it but. That was pretty cool. He said impressed himself. Yeah I said hold on a second. I got a video. I got to keep this on my phone.
91:45,You've played 10 years in the big leagues you've seen a lot of great hitters it's just different with Ohtani I haven't seen that left handed pop like that it's just impressive how the ball just.
92:0,that jumps off his back just clobbered a line drive his last time up but it was caught over to this one a big topper and a little kick foul it's only two.
92:15,I talked to the manager for Yama and I asked him you know I know Japan players Japanese players are known to work very hard and for the most part all of them have the same routine. He said Yeah yeah. Show Hill Tony. He's on a whole nother level of a program. He can do it.
92:30,whatever he wants and it's not that he doesn't work hard but it works very hard. He the coaches they're not messing with this guy. Let him do his thing. Oh to the lines that went into left field and that's.
92:45,It's going to be a hit for Ohtani from one star to another or Rosarito picks it up and Ohtani trying to help get his team going. Rarely see emotion for Shohei that's emotion right there.
93:0,"and if Japan's going to get something going, it's got to start with Shohei. You see him get that fastball right there. It just gets enough of it. Staying short with it, driving it the other way. Randy can't do much more."
93:15,There he is against a guy who's been tough on him or Kitty. Those two face each other in the same division in the league West and that time Ohtani got the best of it.
93:30,and he's had two nice swings line drive singles each time up he's eight for 17 in this world baseball classic.
93:45,and the bats have gotten better and better. They have been yes they have been not necessarily a fastball count here.
94:0,the Yankees I know he's got a good change up for three innings were pretty quiet for this Japanese.
94:15,and he's offense last two plus a lot of good swings so far though nothing to show for it still down three nothing spot in the championship.
94:30,game on the line and a little squib shot foul that's a good change up right there so now it's two to two let's go down to J.P. what a great horn section in left field here at Lone Depot Park wherever Samurai Japan travels there.
94:45,the fans go with them and there is a specific anthem that all those loyal supporters know for every single player in the lineup. And here they are singing their song for Yoshida with some gusto to two big chopper.
95:0,first backhanded by Meneses gets the added second to throw the first down in time at too much speed right there. Double him up.
95:15,"Very good job on Meneses getting that long hop. Look how he gives himself an angle here. He takes a couple steps forward once he's catching it to give himself an angle and not hit the runner on the back. That's a very good play by Meneses, which..."
95:30,It's a very tough play for the first baseman to me he's talking about the light that was inches away from that ball being on the lights very hard to see the long hops.
95:45,never know when you need it. So now we're a commie 0 4 2 and he struck out twice the first pitch here he is just out of sight.
96:0,"of sorts at the plate. Yeah, but they've done a good job on him. Especially right here in this halfback, starting him off slow. They're kind of baiting him. It's slow, slower, and then speeding him up with fastballs and cutters in."
96:15,The problem is when you're going this bad it feels like there's a huge glove all over the field. Anything you hit either gets caught or if you get a good pitch to hit you'll miss it.
96:30,inside they've done a good job of that right there moving his feet moving his eyes and then going back to the slow stuff
96:45,the night. Yes that was a swing according to Lance Barksdale. You're going bad. All that goes against you.
97:0,The check swings the tough pitches take a look if he goes right here. Oh yeah he went.
97:15,one to Morikami strikes out for the third time in the first six
97:30,got a good pitch right there hanging change up you see that right shoulder leaking whether or not you're going to fall tip on whether or not your eyes are moving just not being able to slow things down right now.
97:45,Got a feel for him a little bit there just a massive star in Japan and a guy they really count on in the middle of this lineup it's been a tough night for him to down Komoto.
98:0,who has had some good swings including the one last time Rosarito robbed him of a home run.
98:15,of a 2003 North Dakota Cowboys
98:30,the drum for Venezuela in the dugout we got the sombrero in the dugout for Mexico.
98:45,ball for pitch they call there
99:0,down in a way right there. How much you can do right there. Instead of 3 0 it's 2 1. Big opening on the right side of the infield way outside.
99:15,side with a breaking ball not close so it might be that he hasn't thrown a strike yet. He got a very fortunate call three and one to a good hitter
99:30,home runs for five straight years in Japan he takes that's a two hour walk that's a good at bat.
99:45,You want to talk about how intense this inning is getting the pitcher that's pitching right now usually they're sitting on the bench trying to preserve their energy Yamamoto's got the glove just in case the third out but he's watching he wants to top step his teammate
100:0,He's staying loose but he's he's in the top step making sure that he can get a good eye on everything that's happening. So this is the manager. And she he'll coming out to talk to her. I don't know that this is necessarily pitching change coming.
100:15,This is I want to look into your eyes and I want to know what you've got. Can you get one more guy out for me. Very stressful situation came in in a stressful situation. This is just him letting him know. We live and die with you.
100:30,need your best right here.
100:45,and now Yamada 1 4 2 3 hits in the world baseball classic for
101:0,Not a big power hitter trying to keep the rally going to want to out. Takes a strike. That's a good fastball right there. You know he's been going soft especially with runners in scoring position. It's a good adjustment right there changing it up on him.
101:15,ball one strike having a hard
101:30,Take a look at that leg kick right there to two step leg kick that's beautiful in it out over the plate stylish hitter.
101:45,Ball pop foul back out of play fastball in on his hands. That was a good pitch right there though. Just seeing that big leg kick. He was late with the leg kick there. That was a good pitch. Riding into his hands.
102:0,"and you see him bail out, you see the leg kick, and look how he rushes to it. Oh! He just rushes to it. Now you can speed him up, you can slow him down, you can do a lot of things with him. One-two."
102:15,outside he just he's missing big with that pitch right now that's a ball out of the hand that's got to slow it down with that left shoulder you can go back in there if you want.
102:30,and it's their big pitch here action pitch to to say or TV to do it is high.
102:45,five miles an hour he tried he tried to go back in there he just rushed it a little bit problem is do you test it again
103:0,with two down and a full count. The runners can get the head start.
103:15,He tried that breaking ball right now he just does not have a feel for that pitch the bases are loaded.
103:30,pitch looks like his manager sticking with her key to thaw.
103:45,third inning in a row where Japan's offense putting big pressure on Mexico another big opportunity though.
104:0,for Suzuki and with a broken finger trying to come through. He takes inside ball one he worked it really gritty at bat and finally drew.
104:15,to walk his last time up he saw a lot of fastballs in the prior at bat he was late on everything so a fastball there but it missed one of the bases loaded two down and a strike.
104:30,a change up and more than not that's coming from Barnes understanding he's being a little too quick with his pitches well if you're too quick what do you do you slow him down throw me a change up here that's a good pitch now the timing's back on it.
104:45,the one one that one is hit down
105:0,led by Beck three nothing
105:15,This copyrighted telecast is presented by authority of World Baseball Classic Game it may not be reproduced or retransmitted in any form the accounts and descriptions of this game may not be desirable.
105:30,Miami has been such a great post one more game to go after tonight the championship game of this world baseball classic will it be Mexico or Japan Japan has to decide.
105:45,has built tons of opportunity these last three innings and still has not broken through its three nothing thanks to the guy at the plate Luis Urias swings the first pitch fastball here.
106:0,They've left a lot of guys on base for Japan really can tell that the five days have been a test and I agree with you but
106:15,Sometimes in this sport even good at bats don't get rewarded. Ground ball is short this time for Rios and Japan has had some hard hit balls at some point it's like hit it to anybody but Randy or Rosarito find somewhere else to hit.
106:30,hit the ball absolutely. Because early on the offense for Japan just wasn't there. Last few innings a lot of loud contact. That guy in the Mexican defense.
106:45,defense has just been too good. He's having fun huh. Not one ounce of stress. No one out here in the seven perfect pitch.
107:0,from Yamamoto who's been impressive since coming in the game. Talk about stress. I don't think I would have nails. This game. Yeah it just it's.
107:15,It's really cool to see the best players in the world that was a swing. So the count is only two it's March I mean it's a time in baseball where usually you know we're just playing practice games getting ready for the games that really count.
107:30,They've been so sharp it feels like they're playing in the middle of July right now it feels like October clean baseball O2 off the outside
107:45,pitchers not giving an inch 1 2
108:0,Allen Trejo has gone from 0 2 to 2 and to give you a trail here they've gone for the most part away from him there's no need to leak only.
108:15,who think inside think if it's inside it's just more of a surprise pitch they're trying here we go set that target in to do and he was ready for it pulled it down the left field line that is a foul ball.
108:30,ball impressive try it had to feel like hey we've just gone way too much away on him let's try to sneak a fastball inside that missed by a foot at most.
108:45,here so another 2 2 2 tray hole from Yanomoto rocks back.
109:0,strike breaking ball slowly hit to third it is a foul ball and a good decision very good decision right there or a commie to let it kick foul.
109:15,tournament at the plate kind
109:30,to start to see it on his face. Yeah pressing thinking about it left a lot of guys on base
109:45,Yamamoto was in waiting just
110:0,He sort of looks like a veteran out there he's only 24 years old. He would be in trouble with a new pitch clock. He would have to pick up the pace. Very likely.
110:15,that at the end of this baseball season the posting system for players in Japan so we say posted essentially made available to big league teams to make a contract offer so I think
110:30,twenty twenty four we're likely going to see this guy in Major League Baseball a little teaser here tonight three to Trejo takes one for Wow.
110:45,"Very good at bat right there. I just think for Yamamoto, he just didn't execute. He was disgusted with himself right there. He had the chance, he had him. Had him basically."
111:0,he put away this wasn't able to execute kind of overthrow a little bit right there so that's a one out base runner for Mexico they haven't had a hit.
111:15,since the three run homer back in the fourth inning. It's really been an amazing game here. And the dirt good block by the catcher Kai.
111:30,very good block right there going back to Murakami the third baseman you know you can talk about having a bad night but i guarantee you he's thinking about one more chance one more opportunity
111:45,He knows who he is as a baseball player. He knows he's had success. He knows he's done very well in the past. He just wants one more opportunity. He's definitely going to get at least one more at bat here in the league.
112:0,of this game one pitch and that went off the inside so Yamamoto after getting ahead of Trejo and to now he's sort of lost the strike zone.
112:15,I would think there would be some movement in the bullpen. Seventh innings. Very important. You don't want to Rosarito to face him. In a tight situation. If he's still as erratic.
112:30,right now he's erratic that one is badly three and he was working with a much better rhythm before and I don't know what I don't know whether it's conscious or he's slowed it down a little bit.
112:45,down but has no feel it doesn't look like they're kind of just waiting for the call. Brianna to Alec Thomas that's a
113:0,strike this is the bottom part of the order Yamamoto does not want to be giving away free base runners already down three nothing usually.
113:15,That's how the big rallies start when you turn over the line up. Here's the 3-1 runner going and it's a check swing foul.
113:30,"Thomas tried to hold up Trejo was off and running, but he'll have to go back I would think he will be running again here. Take a look here at this"
113:45,ball 10 starting to get loose in the bullpen.
114:0,three and two Trejo not running
114:15,La emergency light starts flashing at the experiencer. The person needs to provide a jelly B 있으면Viewerっていうのらだ
114:30,to this time Trejo does run
114:45,it's swung on and hit foul Thomas again just a little foul ball boy I got to tell you there's a huge gap in right center that ball as we see here this fall tip ouch
115:0,Huge gap in right center I mean anything gets hit into the outfield there's a lot of speed on the bases and that guy hitting right now he's got a lot of speed as well big outfielder
115:15,field here with a split 3 2 Trejo runs it is swung on and missed. Here comes the throw.
115:30,around the tag and they didn't get it somehow trail got around the tag who's going swimming Trejo's going swimming what a swim move right there.
115:45,"and then they're going to challenge it. Let's take a look right here. I don't think he ever got him, did he?"
116:0,"Wow. Well, I maybe maybe what the challenge is. Was there a split second in the safe call on that."
116:15,second base not yet there. So the hand is on then the tag is on is there a moment where the hand comes off right there and the tag is on the leg maybe. But is it enough. They already called them safe.
116:30,It's got to be very conclusive. Not yet hand off their glove on leg I think he's out.
116:45,and fans disagree with me they think he's safe but I think you got to wait and let it play out here there
117:0,I think I think it's just not enough evidence and it might be right but if it's me making the call what a what a cool move though huh. It was a great effort by right there.
117:15,there Wow so it's either out number three if they overturn the call and the side is retired or runner in scoring position for.
117:30,Barnes that's Barksdale the crew chief the guy who's got the earpiece in.
117:45,every time the fans get to see the replay I think that hands off I think I think he's out
118:0,that the replay umpires see it
118:15,three run a homer back in the fourth that has held up until now let's get the call.
118:30,We think they've taken their time though Lance gave me the umpires balked there I thought he was ready to say what the call was so we wait and see what
118:45,I always felt when they took their time like this it was safe it would go the runner's way but we'll see OK let's get the call now.
119:0,Maybe. You're right.
119:15,So for Japan maybe that can build a little momentum nine one two and then Ohtani coming up in the bottom of the seven he's done it again and I read the arrow.
119:30,Serena part of Team Mexico stealing the show so far but still nine outs to go to get into the championship game against the United States ball one from Orchidi and a pitcher friendly strike there it's one and one I would think.
119:45,The urgency starts right now. Yeah. Team Japan. It's gotta happen. Right. Now. And he's one run. Kai pushes a button. Foul. Just not a great hitter.
120:0,pitch hitter for their starting catcher but anyway he could get on base to get the top of the order to up next.
120:15,Wanted to or Kady struck him out swinging one out Lars Dukes Barna swinging one out Lars Dukes
120:30,"are coming up who's so thrilled to be playing for Team Japan. This was Lars as a little leaguer talking about maybe being here someday. Konnichiwa, my name is Lars Neupahr, number 21."
120:45,"and I'm Japanese I hope I do good during all sides and I'm going to represent my country for Japan. Isn't that pretty cool? He says yes on his literally cap. El Segundo, California native."
121:0,his mom who grew up in Japan his mom's family his grandparents still live just outside Tokyo. And he is the first player not born in Japan to represent this team he drives this one toward the gap in left center a Rosa Reina gets to another one.
121:15,hit it somewhere else he's 0 4 2
121:30,game but he saved at least four or five runs he's hit a grand slam on defense basically he can just catch everything right now.
121:45,by the Northlanders is pretty routine still though a hard hit ball and tough luck for Japan. Not as easy as people may think you got the lights coming. You've got the left hander who hit it. The ball sliding from you or into you.
122:0,the first time that ball was one hundred and five miles off the bat. So it's not like it's a gimme allowed contact in this game.
122:15,has almost always come from Japan and yet they're down three nothing foul to the backstop. He got Ohtani waiting on deck. It's the seventh inning.
122:30,This might be Japan's last chance to get Ohtani to the plate with somebody on base if Kondo can get there. I've not been able to find any spots out there against this defense.
122:45,one to Mexico you're just thinking about all the odds you're counting them down the most.
123:0,The most stressful part of this game is that right now. We need seven more. That one is lined up in a leaping attempt to Maria's base hit. So Kondo he's hit the ball hard three times and he does reach to give Ohtani.
123:15,chance I would think this is it for our kitties. That's been three hard hit balls. You see that breaking ball not that much bite more of a hanger Hondo did a really good job of staying.
123:30,through that pitch absolute rock gets himself a base hit but it's huge for Japan even though Tony is not going to face Orchidi just to get their great slugger up with somebody on base that at bat right after this.
123:45,"A proud night in Magdalena de Quinoa, Sonora, Mexico, because a native of that town, Luis Urias, has accounted for Mexico's 3-0 lead in this crucial"
124:0,baseball classic Mexico's most popular sport is soccer but there it is baseball and a great story written recently by Maria Guarnato at MLB dot com about the Urias brothers Luis's old
124:15,oldest brother Ramone actually won a gold glove at third base last year for the Baltimore Orioles. The boys got their love of the game from their father Ramone Senior a school teacher. Family proud. Thank you JP tonight.
124:30,Rodriguez with that bolt of lightning the three run homer back in the fourth inning it stayed three nothing since then now Jojo Romero and welcome to the ballgame you got to face maybe the world's greatest player Shohei.
124:45,by Ohtani could be his final at bat of this game we'll see with two outs left against left and a fastball at ninety five but a little bit high you're going to get a fastball by Ohtani better.
125:0,Big moment Romero 26 years old and a slider is low to an 0.
125:15,And if you walk in because he's so fearsome then the cleanup hitter comes up as the tying run and if you're the outfielders right now you're playing as deep as possible.
125:30,You're playing kind of no doubles man to a slider again I don't think he's really seeing that pitch all that well but he's a head 3 0.
125:45,I would think he wouldn't see a strike here I mean yeah you know there's no no need for the for anything to change here for your Mexico a 3 0 count to Ohtani
126:0,that is a strong but very gutsy. Yeah I don't know if maybe 3 0 you feel like in a three nothing game he's going to be taking maybe.
126:15,He won't be taking here automatically and now Yoshida comes up as the tying run.
126:30,happened once again we talked about the urgency and the seventh inning they've answered rather than his current position they left two men on base in the fourth inning they left three on base in the fifth
126:45,left they left three on base in the sixth and another opportunity here this one comes with two down but Masataka Yoshida has two hits tonight two for three.
127:0,Romero and a good swing foul straight back but a good fastball right there I mean that pitch needed to be in and then if you wanted to miss more in he couldn't afford to be over the plate.
127:15,complete with that pitch getting ready to start his major league journey. But first things first semifinals of the World Baseball Classic 0 1.
127:30,Off the inside it came back in and this time Yoshida didn't swing. He's rushed him now to fast balls inside. What I've seen from you.
127:45,Chita he's been able to back up the baseball very well went soft on it wanted to very good changeup.
128:0,changeup we saw and now we're seeing it again with Romero.
128:15,two on two out seventh inning the 1 2 he's amped up he's thrown hard.
128:30,the road to first Yoshida has really gotten out of the strike zone. I think you rubber was was
128:45,field they've tried he's been pretty good with it now the two to it is hit high and deep down the right field line.
129:0,Toward the corner it is.
129:15,game they've answered the urgency was put to test their
129:30,What a moment! What a moment for Yoshida! Wow!
129:45,He went back to the change up a little bit fooled but man those lefties you throw them down and in. Oh mistakes.
130:0,Off the far pole. What a moment.
130:15,seventh inning Japan's championship hopes are alive.
130:30,great as Ohtani is and he's great you walk in and the time run comes up I was getting ready to say the same thing. Yeah. Show here right there led to that 0 2.
130:45,to come back from this is more common Moon and Taika Biden got to be so careful with changeups the lefties.
131:0,because it just runs into their barrels even if you're full it just continues to run into it even if that's a one handed home run right there about the art.
131:15,RBI is 13 that's a new record in the history of the world baseball classic to do.
131:30,I've never seen show here this animated tells you how much it means to him Can you imagine Tokyo right now It's not good e.g.
131:45,Benoit anymore they're open at some point here this evening called Benoit to two and a Papa Murakami third base side it will be.
132:0,for Japan to tie the game we go to the eighth it's three to three.
132:15,Let's take a look at this pitch sequence against Yoshida. You rushed him with fastballs inside. Now you've got him set up for the soft stuff. You throw the good changeup. I thought that was a good pitch.
132:30,and you can't repeat with it. It's such a dangerous pitch to the left handers. Once you get fooled that changes continues to roll into the barrel. And my oh my Yoshida with one of the biggest swings of his life. They got the bench.
132:45,So now a whole new ball game and Mexico has to feel a little stunned after that swing it's three to three and a half.
133:0,eighth inning you got the ninth place hitter Austin Barnes and then the top of the order coming up again Yamamoto still in the game strike it's over to that's good fastball right there.
133:15,only forty five pitches for Yamamoto who is a starter 0 2 to find a hitter can you do that
133:30,starts he lost it there for a little bit at the top of the seven with his command but starting him off right here with the first hitter he's got commanding.
133:45,Once again with that fastball Especially at the top of the zone Orange just couldn't hold up Well It's set up for Randy Rosarena
134:0,for him defensively now trying to do it at the plate one out and he takes a strike fastball right there down in the way.
134:15,on the night and they've been difficult with him. It tucked up. They pitched him in very tough that one is like the right the going back quickly and over the head of convo.
134:30,double up against the wall. A Rosarito in the second with a one out double you want to talk about bat speed.
134:45,"Randy Rosarito has just displayed it, gets that splitter, but look how deep he hits it. How connected he is with his backside. Oh my, absolute rocket."
135:0,All he's thinking right there is any little bobble I'm going three no bobble I stay at second and I get to enjoy it.
135:15,What a show 1 0 7 off the bat for Rosarito first hit a lot by Yamamoto and the go ahead run is in scoring position for Alex Verdugo.
135:30,pitch. Leiter left center field that's going to be a hit and Mexico is going to go back ahead. Rosarito is in the score Verdugo with a double.
135:45,baseball it's four to three
136:0,in San Diego Wow. It's a fastball up in the zone. Another guy they pitch very tough. But how clutch has he been throughout this whole.
136:15,tournament against Puerto Rico and now against Japan it's a fastball over the plate and he knows it yeah this is our game
136:30,six to three how clutches done that was quite a response. After what just happened in the seventy Rosarito and do go
136:45,Mexico put Mexico right back ahead to their top hitters have come up clutch they've answered the bell they're going to remove Verdugo for a pinch runner I'm assuming that's Duran so you have the new.
137:0,two Red Sox outfielder Yoshida who hit the homerun to tie the game for Dugo Red Sox outfielder puts Mexico back ahead Duran Red Sox outfielder runs for Verdugo they have a lot of outfielders in Boston.
137:15,What a great problem to have. Now join Vanessa's a chance to add to the lead this would be huge. 
137:30,not close you know one thing he's a fastball hitter about the two homer game.
137:45,They're both on fastballs.
138:0,would be just massive one of the Nassau's line drive foul to the split right there off the end of the bat broke his back fast play once again.
138:15,changes speed was the execution there that pitch was up in the zone. That's kind of where Manassas needs to look and needs to stay top of the zone is green light bottom of the zone red light.
138:30,"On the other side of field, a couple of guard groups make their way in On field, on the grass, a crumpet player throws the ball Will there be a pocket-save?"
138:45,This part has a lot of askellic patterns and is kind of a pen food. This is a somewhat cool video thanks for watching.
139:0,Now pick up play and he got back
139:15,second third out closer than it looked it was executed well
139:30,And the lead's a little shorter now after that pick off the 1 1 on the ground and the whole base hit the ran had to wait though so he'll go to third and stop.
139:45,and that's his legs to pull the
140:0,"He sure does right there. The big strong slugger. Watch the runner right here. I feel like he has to wait. There could have always been a play at third base. It's a good base running there. Right, Durant?"
140:15,I think Japan's going into the bullpen. Yamamoto the greatest pitcher in Japan is coming out of this game after three consecutive hits Mexico back in front and threatening for more.
140:30,back right after this wow what a last 20 minutes or so Japan with an incredible rally and a three run homer to tie the game and now Mexico has answered back with a run.
140:45,and knocked Yamamoto out of the game so at Suki you also takes over. Well he's the right guy he let he let the MPB with 43 holes in 2022 23 year old. They're going to be looking for him to finish this inning right here.
141:0,here with no more runs it was his rookie year last year and he really turned into the best set up man in Japan and he's going to need to do some excellent work here because it is a.
141:15,challenge you got a big league slugger coming up first and third only one out and for Mexico just finding a way to get one more across.
141:30,It only be six outs away from a spot in the championship game.
141:45,the hitter tell us if you get a ball on the ground he got a chance to turn to you know one thing with us and he's got a really good split bottom with the split is there's a lot of holes open especially the one at first base.
142:0,with the runner on first base. They've moved the second baseman over to try to plug some of that hole but you're right to tell us first pitch swinging foul down the left field line.
142:15,You tell us you want to get that pitch exactly like that one up in the zone. The worst thing that can happen here is a strike is a double play. The worst thing.
142:30,Here's the old couple Kobe moments for Joe Richard. Now golf players get a little taste of how the veteran fastballs at the plate can play for the Lakers. Well it's going to only rain tomorrow. Tonight we're talking bad weather at Dayrton workout field. More bad weather on the list. Too bad tomorrow isn't so good anyway. True right quick. Two important things. That's right. Welcome to the Pack City Conference.
142:45,time huge spot for this young
143:0,man here's his own one tell us to strike fastball right there.
143:15,He doesn't like it but we'll go back into the video room and take a look at it. I was a very well executed pitch right there. I was a you thought it was low tell us.
143:30,double plays just doesn't have a
143:45,and the pinch runner at third
144:0,to two but that's his runs and the pitch is taken for a ball. That's a huge stolen base right there by Manassas.
144:15,That's taking advantage of your eyes are right there knowing he would be going with soft stuff trying to get the strikeout Not necessarily the double play Great heads-up play right there. Yeah that changes everything now the infield has to come in you have no double play possibility now
144:30,around Japan trying to cut down Duran at home on a ground ball. Maybe you also can try to pitch for the strikeout. Want to tell us strikes out swinging got him with the splitter.
144:45,"What an absolute beauty of a splitter. Oh, that is disgusting right there. You see that split? How much it drops. I mean, you can sit on it."
145:0,but it's got so much tilt down. Not a happy camper right now. Another image. We've just seen it over and over again.
145:15,and how much these games mean to these guys who play in the big leagues and yet this world baseball classic they are pouring everything into these games the soccer Reddits two for three it's been a huge part of the Mexico.
145:30,on offense second and third two outs. Pitcher friendly strike their.
145:45,You know one thing with it is he likes the ball at him. When Walcott as you say you have a little bit of a short fuse the umpire he's barking right back at Benji Hill the manager.
146:0,the 0 1 that's where you want to go if you're there and you also down in a way all his hits for parades has been in or up in the zone.
146:15,Bongood bowie strikes again just out of the blue! Tattered Falcons go down with him! Wildcat gets the bow again!
146:30,Here's the 1 1 trying to breaking ball and missed high with a beauty of this is that the team USA they're watching they're using a lot of arms out of the bullpen for Mexico and for Japan
146:45,The U.S. team got tested with the back to back quarterfinal semifinal but once they won those two games now they may have an advantage for the championship. Who will they play next year.
147:0,Mexico or Japan. Two and one. On the ground base hit in the left field. Durant and here comes Manassas the throw the tag got him at the plate.
147:15,But another run for Mexico after the rally for Japan to tie the game a two run eighth can Japan come up with a second.
147:30,with another round of offense. What a play at the plate. On action we've had action.
147:45,here in Miami tonight the semifinal game Mexico what a response after Japan tied the game an extra run and a play at the plate. Great tag great throw.
148:0,to the O'shea does doing it all he hit the home run to tie the game. Inside Paredes has five hits in the last two games and four runs batted in high and tight and it hit him.
148:15,Nakamoto power hitter first pitch from Cruz just in the game and he gets hit. That's the last thing you want to see right now. Get into a pickle first guy he sees in a Pomodoro.
148:30,to you know he's Cruz he's got a bid to upper fastball 90s fastball a good slider just a two pitch guy fastball slider that's what you're going to see seen in two games right there three strikeouts just one run in two innings.
148:45,He's got to come out firing on all cylinders right here. He's going to use a pinch runner Okamoto big first baseman so they'll get some more speed on the bases down two runs and then he's going to use a pinch runner.
149:0,last inning you're up to and you walk Oh Tommy and you put the tying run at the plate. Knock it off the pinch runner over there at first. Yamada the hitter.
149:15,Cruz Duran was the runner for Verdugo so he takes over in right field.
149:30,The Yamada is the seventh place hitter they're not quite guaranteed that they'd love to make sure that they get Ohtani up in the top of the eighth inning.
149:45,up at least one more time so you build any kind of rally here and you make sure you get your big boy in the night. That's your goal. You know they've done a good job though of getting base runners they have.
150:0,that's a good writing fastball right there that's a zip on it.
150:15,Los Angeles on the ground and
150:30,This game is a long way from over. Oh you know it you know it it just smells like there's more here. So high chopper right here or it is did everything possible.
150:45,you can do with it. The problem is here that now the small ball comes to play especially with Yamada. J.P. Dave Yamada is the only player in this
151:0,"lineup who was part of the semifinal loss to the U.S. six years ago. He is the veteran influence on this team. And I think it's shown tonight, JP, because he's got two hits and a walk. He's had good at bats all game long."
151:15,I was sacrificing time because you get the guy who's got the broken finger again who's already given it up he's already showing that he's going to square around now that doesn't mean it's not possible that he could pull the bat back and try to chop one pass and drawn in infield.
151:30,around early the situation like this the but needs to be
151:45,the third base hard to third. You've got to make the third baseman field the ball. The play has got to be only at first. This is a good time right now for a mountain visit kind of rally everybody together and say OK this is where you're going to go. Yeah.
152:0,everybody's got to go here let's just calm down not just the pitcher this is for the pitcher and everybody's got to talk in this meeting right now talk to Manassas you tell him OK you're crashing Cruz you've got the third base side Trejo you've got to be here.
152:15,here where everybody's got a job to do.
152:30,Mexico after the Orias home run all the way into the bottom of the seventh and a two hour rally the three run homer to tie the game Mexico goes back ahead now Japan threatening it with a home run.
152:45,again still showing fun here Cruz they'll put the wheel play on and the pitch is taken high trail King sprinting over to third so that we'll play it was.
153:0,Basically done to get the out a third it would have been a double play third to first. That's the play right there. That's a surprising play. Doesn't really happen. Yeah you're right. And remember you get the pinch runner at second knock on who's got pretty good.
153:15,good speed out there to win the but foul I always like to tell is a dicey play but I always like to tell the second base runner if you see the shortstop going you go right with.
153:30,and it's an easy stolen base to third base. Now it's gutsy very gutsy. Tough pitch right there to put on a pop up waiting to happen. He helped him out to that would have been ball three.
153:45,but two one one foul to a two
154:0,Trejo sprinting over to third that time he jabs at it you know he jabs at it when you jab at it more than not you're going to file it off. I would think the bun is still on here. You've got to trust your guy.
154:15,Maybe part of that is just that finger injury for this short stop to a two he's showing but got to get it down he butts and he does get it down. But that's his way of getting it down.
154:30,to look but take the throw to first and almost a disaster. Rios came over to cover and the throw was a little off line but they do get the out. Oh that was gutsy right there with two strikes.
154:45,That is a do-or-die bunt right there. Look how gutsy this is. Gets his nose right in it. You already know he's got a pinky. Broken. It is do-or-die for him. Wow.
155:0,just made the right decision there the speed on the bases help for Japan we're going to get another pinch hitter.
155:15,Otaka Yamakawa is at the plate. Third different hitter in this spot in the lineup tonight in the dirt and it kicks up off of.
155:30,Yamakawa's face what a block it was a good block but even so Mexico got a little lucky there if that gets by The hitter who knows look at this right here Everything he's got It's up the helmet
155:45,down if that hadn't hit him it might have rolled far enough away for Nakano to score from third that one is driven to left field a Rosarito will make it.
156:0,catch he'll come in to score the throw goes to third it's a one run game another hard hit ball tracked down by Rosarito.
156:15,"Yamakawa got the job done, got the run in. And we know who's going to have one more at bat. Gets that fastball right there, up in the zone. Yamakawa was putting on a..."
156:30,against play in batting practice today by the way hitting balls all over the field simplifies the approach gets the job done and the extra run feels so big that Mexico added.
156:45,on to their lead but also the play at home plate is looming large to we have had an action packed late innings tonight now another meeting which means we're going to have a new pitcher here.
157:0,with the left handed hitters lined up including Lars Newt Barr one run game tying run in scoring position after this rookies
157:15,to Saki the Japanese pitching sensation through four innings tonight. And since he left the game he has been standing exactly where you see him right now pensively watching and cheering and supporting his teammates Dave and yonder.
157:30,"That's the sign of a great teammate and someone who is so emotionally invested in this classic game unfolding before us. Meanwhile, with Team Mexico, one more out to get before Giovanni Gallegos could pitch the ninth. He has yet to allow an earner."
157:45,run in this world baseball classic I just wish J.P. were more invested. What a moment for Ray is right here baseball theater in Miami.
158:0,play again tonight Reyes against Newt Barr tie run in scoring position two down one thing with Reyes those his knock.
158:15,like a man and he can man last year and triple a forty six games thirty three base on balls that's a lot. He's got a big arm but he's got to be able to control it.
158:30,That's low. To one. What a moment for Noop bar. He's had a good advantage. Japan is his opponent.
158:45,He's only had eight hits they've hit a lot of balls hard new barn lying down to a Rosarito his last time up.
159:0,Ray is throwing that four seed fastball but it's actually he's got a late little cut to it especially to the left handers
159:15,at the last second Mexico needs an out Japan needs a hit to one off the inside three and one
159:30,It's got to start kind of middle away for you to go on. On deck. Kanske condos hit one line drive after another in this game and then.
159:45,Mike let's just remember to buckle up. You've pulled in. I think for Newgrover to even with three to.
160:0,You've got to pull him. Can't be jammed right here. Got to make sure you
160:15,get a strike though that's first then after is the approach son of California kid been dreaming about playing for Japan since he was 12 years old.
160:30,So he draws the walk and that's the go ahead run aboard here the eighth inning.
160:45,And Newberg gave him a little bit of a scouting report right there On Kondo he said hey a little bit of a cut fastball he throws and he's got that slider. That's it This guy's been very impressive tonight struck
161:0,down looking his first time up line drive single rocket caught in left and then another bullet line drive single and a run scored two on two out Ohtani now in the on deck circle.
161:15,that's a strike seven on the outside that's tough because Newport tells you it's a ball that's cutting and all of a sudden it's got to go.
161:30,and you start riding sick to it all of a sudden now your approach gets questioned.
161:45,He's late to on that condo he needs a minute.
162:0,three nothing then three to three then five to three now five to four.
162:15,the.
162:30,season ninety seven at the knees we go to the ninth five to four Mexico.
162:45,"Oh, we take a look at this absolute gorgeous pitch from Reyes 97 miles an hour painted on the knees. Not much you can do right there. "
163:0,You had two really good fastballs to do something with it. It was good morning. Good afternoon. Good night. Great pitching right there. It really really was. Some Mexico.
163:15,coming on to a one run lead. And now I say Ota for his third appearance of this world baseball classic trying to keep this a one run game with Ohtani do up in the bottom of the ninth inning.
163:30,beginning Luis Arias was three run homer the big swing of the night for Mexico against OTA. Wow well should have been a strike but the catcher dropped it was just into the game.
163:45,when he dropped the ball it cost his pitcher a strike. He's got a little handcuffed right there. You know one thing about Tyson has a heavy fastball good splitter. Ball to right and number one.
164:0,Lots of changes for Japan moving things around Yamada goes from second to play first not going to the pinch runner. He stays in the game and plays second base and a new catcher.
164:15,the end of the game but maybe it'll be settled down now. She will talk about all those fastball splitter I mean guy like all rookies and saves last year.
164:30,"Fly ball shallow left falling and it'll be back to the infield the shortstop, Genda Wow Not an easy"
164:45,play so many things happening going back on the ball. You've got the left fielder coming. You've got to tell him you've got it right at the last minute pop your glove out and hopefully you get lucky and get that guy lucky.
165:0,Oh he's so good yeah you can see why he's considered the best defensive shortstop in Japan so two quick outs
165:15,"And pacing, looming, waiting. He's going to lead off in the bottom of the ninth. Another pitch dropped, but called a strike. And I think for Otani..."
165:30,You know everybody wants to see him hit the home run but you know that's kind of always lurking in the back of your head. You don't go chase the home run you just get a good pitch to hit that leads to a home run. Oh and two and it's really it's setting.
165:45,coming up almost like a Barry Bonds situation it's a one run game. Do you pitch to him and risk one swing tie game. If you if you pitch him too carefully he's one of the fastest players in the game and the tying run as a board to start.
166:0,at the beginning to us. That's the problem right there is you've got so many variables but for Tony he's about trying to simplify everything as much as possible going over the scouting.
166:15,He knows he's got a good change of he knows he's got that writing fastball they're going over it right now and all you start doing is thinking OK visualizing what am I going to get first pitch where are the percentages.
166:30,is what am I going to do with it.
166:45,So he got ahead of Alec Thomas and couldn't put him away. Ouch takes the hat off gives a little bow to Alec Thomas just to acknowledge.
167:0,that's a slider right there yeah front foot that's going to hurt tomorrow right now with the adrenaline it hurts a little bit but tomorrow will hurt
167:15,Thomas hoping he has to play through some pain tomorrow. Mexico is three outs away from a spot in the championship game against the United States. No matter what it's going to be a scene. Oh yeah.
167:30,Thomas is bored he's got if he's running okay he's got great speed
167:45,ball but not a balky wasn't engaged yet so Austin Barnes comes up for three tonight the Dodgers catcher.
168:0,Pulls that one foul.
168:15,with Ohtani coming up if Mexico could find a way to get Alec Thomas home. Oh. Big time. You'd be freed up to just go after him. Now we're talking.
168:30,one dropped again another close pitch man Oshiro having a really hard time that was a close pitch as well.
168:45,crashing bat earlier in the inning. Just getting handcuffed a little bit a little late with his timing of the gloves knocking
169:0,A lot of times for a catcher you set that target but if you're not ready for the pitch to come and you're dropping your target to get ready for the ball to come to you you're late with it very hard to come back with that especially with the late movement right now.
169:15,And Odom you need to be solid here in a one to count. Here's the pitch Thomas runs Swann on a missed strike three.
169:30,strikeout and here we go a one run game and maybe the most fearsome hitter in the world is going to lead off show a Ohtani and Japan down a run.
169:45,You just can't ask for more than this show. Tony and Team Japan their hopes of a third world baseball classic championship are in jeopardy in this semifinal game of the year.
170:0,game and really one of the better relief pitchers in the big leagues Giovanni Gallegos who's been throwing the ball great trying to get the final three outs and get Mexico into the championship game. It's a one run game and Ohtani is going to lead off. He's got his work cut out.
170:15,out for him for the first hitter in Ohtani but Ohtani against Gallego is very very tough to Diego you know he's got that nice right and forcing but his pitches that change will we see it right now what a matchup
170:30,game it's always fun to watch
170:45,Ohtani tonight has lined out singled walked after striking out looking all the way back in the first inning. So here we go. Bottom of the ninth guy goes first pitch Ohtani reps a base hit in the right center field.
171:0,double head to the gap. Cut off by Thomas in center field Ohtani steps in second with a lead off double.
171:15,I was a preset determined swing taking what guy was was going to give him. He sat on a pitch in the change up and he got it. And boy he delivered.
171:30,Taking his helmet off and let's see the wheels big boy. It was a great play by Thomas who just got hit on the foot by a pitch to get there and cut it off otherwise Ohtani is a third easy.
171:45,strike Oh man he's unbelievable the approach the execution and the attitude.
172:0,Masataka Yoshida who hit the homerun to tie the game his last time up he could win it with a home run here with a fastball.
172:15,He's set an all time world baseball classic single tournament record with 13 runs batted in he's hit two home runs in his career and he's been hit two home runs in his career and he's been set an all time world baseball classic single tournament record with 13 runs batted in he's hit two home runs in his career and he's been
172:30,home runs he's been locked in. I've just been impressed with the way he can control the strike zone.
172:45,For me it's so key facing a guy he's never seen before with really good stuff that he has got the guy out there on the mound that he wants to run at second.
173:0,Nobody out ninth inning he does such a good job of simplifying everything slowing everything
173:15,down you talk about how when you see the pitches how good you see him you always feel like you're behind the baseball he does such a good job with that I mean you would think take 3 0 but he's
173:30,but he's seen the ball so well
173:45,I think if you're a guy he goes you've got to really execute right now on this pitch understanding you've got more economy behind your sheet who's 0 4 4 with three strikeouts that's the guy they want to highlight in this city.
174:0,you got to make a good pitch here.
174:15,The 3 1 very high ball for well it seems inconceivable the guy who just won the triple crown in Japan who's a two time MVP.
174:30,that he that you would even consider asking him to give himself up but the way he has swung the bat tonight it might be at least a consideration. But we said it in the seventh inning right. He just wants another chance.
174:45,and it's here the chance is here right now for Mr. Murakami Shuto will be the pinch runner for Yoshida. Japan is playing to win this game.
175:0,right here right now. Yukio Shuto the winning run aboard with nobody out and the manager wants to talk and he might be thinking to say I mean to look in a different spot. I don't think it would even be possible.
175:15,possible but Muta Taka Murakami just has not looked comfortable at the plate at all. It could be a situation here where he'll give him one pitch. Yeah. And we'll see what happens.
175:30,It's just game seven you know
175:45,The big slugger stands in two on nobody out looking very hitterish at the plate the pitch he fouls it off to the left out of play that's a good swing right there.
176:0,here it'll be very hard I would think he's swinging. There's there's no budding here me to you've got to trust your guy two time MVP he's been thinking about this moment for six years now he's too good too
176:15,Even if he has a look great tonight.
176:30,pitch softer take right there that's as much softer take we talked a lot of times with him in the front foot how he's leaning to feel the weight of his front foot that was a lot smoother a lot softer.
176:45,Oh one one count though got to win this count good change of count. He's got a good one. He goes looks back at Ohtani the pitch is hit to left.
177:0,center field hit very well and it is off the wall.
177:15,Japan will play for the championship.
177:30,pitch 0 4 for three strikeouts
177:45,that's been thinking about it for six years now a moment in the world baseball classic he will never forget Murakami my oh my a country that is.
178:0,is going absolutely crazy in Japan. It started with Shohei Ohtani and ended with a two time MVP Mr. Murakami. And you just feel horrible for the players.
178:15,from Mexico who spilled their guts out on the field tonight and all tournament but in the end Japan dug deep and Shohei Ohtani will play one.
178:30,one more game in this world baseball classic after every game the bow.
