0:0:0,World Baseball Classic championship game tonight and the very first pitch to Mookie Betts is taken for a strike. What a top of the order and particularly for a left handed pitcher to have to go.
0:0:15,will go through Betts Trout and Goldschmidt right away. A little hesitation Mookie hits a fly ball right center field Condo over and he'll make the catch short of the warning track for our number one. First Piniella Salfaro Park.
0:0:30,back and Quinn Wolcott the rest of this umpire and crew for this championship game first pitch fastball to Mike Trout just misses a little too far inside. We'll see with a man I got though a lot of glove side fastballs trying to tie up these right handers.
0:0:45,One Oh trout swings through the fastball. And that may be but to a hitter I think a lot of times it appears to be faster firmer.
0:1:0,and is hit to shallow right field Kondo has to race in and it's going to fall base in Trout's going to try for second to throw the slide he's safe.
0:1:15,But you want to talk about five to a player and I think Team USA loves the tone setting there from Trout to hustle his way into an extra base hit down Paul Goldschmidt.
0:1:30,breaking ball to steal strike one left handers like Paul Goldschmidt did last year. What a great opportunity for the United States.
0:1:45,the one coach man a big cut in a high fastball. The job with his strike discipline is always swinging at the right pitches.
0:2:0,infectious we're going through the science. Monaco. Will Check Crafted second. Look back. Got it.
0:2:15,to see Paul Bozeman right there having a little talk with Turner Hey talk to me about the split what is it doing we saw so many of the young pitching stars for Japan in last night's semifinal game. Monica.
0:2:30,He's twenty nine years old he's been around a while. Not out of the woods yet Nolan Arnauto first pitch swing and a ground ball to first pick by Okamoto. He'll take it to the bag himself. Rediscover his game.
0:2:45,to fine tune his game first pitch swing Newt Barr against Kelly and a fly ball shallow left field Mullins for number one going to be very difficult to hit Kelly tonight. One pitch one out.
0:3:0,Ken's game condo stands in a good fastball right on the outside corner strike five extra bases and scored nine runs.
0:3:15,last night on the appeal no swing. I like this guy he can hit. Takes that one just inside ball to.
0:3:30,That's a little baby cutter. That's that's the great Ohtani waiting in the on deck circle to one foul tip with the fastball two and two really like also that Martha Rosa put Cedric
0:3:45,Defense is going to be key for two for tonight's game is the reason really he made that decision. Randy Rosarito almost stole the show last night running all over the place catching balls that one hit hard up the middle right into the defense. Trey Turner there.
0:4:0,for round number two red eyed Trey Turner we talk about in the middle of everything last night whether.
0:4:15,Mexico pitched to him or pitched around him the offense for Japan in a lot of ways went right through Shohei Ohtani he was in the mix for all of it.
0:4:30,baseball one outside Japan because he's so great and you want to circle him and say we just can't let him beat us but he's got the teammates if you pitch around him and he's.
0:4:45,he's out there on the bases to make you pay. I would still think you've got to be very careful with show Hilton especially right here a little bit change up count right here from Merrill Kelly.
0:5:0,that's going on right now. Oh it's 2 0 this is badly but that one 3 and 0 and it just really tell going to attack him right now. They're going to give him the Barry Bonds treatment. Nothing. He's not going to beat us. He's been highlighted in today's meeting for TV.
0:5:15,in the U.S.A. I'd highlight him to 3 0 strike this pitch from Merrill Kelly's coming up next is it's either my pitch that's going to be called for a strike or take your walk.
0:5:30,"Good hitter's count for a great hitter. The 3-1. Otani takes ball four. It's close, but a two-out walk. He's been fantastic all tournament long. You look at a good team."
0:5:45,team especially in this tournament two best teams in the tournament you look at them up the middle while they are smooth as it gets. Here's your sheet a little bit high ball one. I think Lance Barksdale our home plate umpire have a small.
0:6:0,What a tournament for Yoshida. Including a huge three run home run last night. He pops this one up behind home plate. Real Muto back to the backstop but it's beyond his reach.
0:6:15,and the way he's going to be able to get that reach think about Merrill Kelly though when he comes inside to left handers kind of gets around the baseball he's got that cutter he's got that run he's got that good change up he's going to need him all time.
0:6:30,tonight he does also have a very good pickoff move it's gonna be tough as long as Kelly's in the game tough to run on USA.
0:6:45,Another pick off throw. The one one. Fouled off to the left.
0:7:0,One strike away from getting through this first inning. Packed house in Miami championship game.
0:7:15,recent weeks of tremendous baseball Kelly's one to sort of flip down the left.
0:7:30,feel alive but foul excess there and it's turned into one of the better starters in the National League for the Arizona Diamondbacks another one to
0:7:45,two to Yoshida. Want us to win this freaking game. There was an intensity with the manager for Team USA Kyle Schwarzer a high strike given by Lance Barksdale.
0:8:0,for any number two we ask Mark DeRosa about what was the message for Team USA says really none. And I think these boys know what they got to do what's at stake. They're ready to roll. Get short with a swing through the.
0:8:15,the fastball zone to a quiet world baseball classic but I don't think there was much of a decision to be made to have him in the lineup. Oh to that one is hit off the end of the bat to right field Condo charging in and he'll get there.
0:8:30,So far for him and Naga it's been that good fastball to start things off say hitters have been thinking about they understood that they had a ride but it's just really getting on them.
0:8:45,the last two games had the home run the team USA will never forget in the come from behind win against Venezuela and then two home runs against Cuba in the semis breaking ball off the outside and it was a dilemma.
0:9:0,because the way the last team USA wanted to move him up but he was so good in that number nine spot. Well there was superstition or comfort or whatever. But here he is hitting sixth and he takes low ball to.
0:9:15,here at home to Turner right back to the backstop. We've seen from Trey Turner is when he gets on a big wave more than not he usually stays on that wave of hitting for a long
0:9:30,Yankee kind of stays consistent gives you good at bats when he's on one usually for a long time to one pitch Turner hits another one down the left field line he's done it again.
0:9:45,and it's gone!
0:10:0,America's shortstop Trey Turner we talked about the way he's riding a big wave trying to throw that cheese inside Trey Turner was absolutely ready for it.
0:10:15,what a week for Trey Turner
0:10:30,Walker what a smile. Diro is just he just didn't want to mess it up by moving.
0:10:45,for the most home runs in a single World Baseball Classic in history and he's going to have some more bats tonight. Who knows inside ball to the real Muto I just want to say
0:11:0,I just don't understand how you even he was ready for a mutual spend three new teammates with Trey Turner went around there to a two.
0:11:15,that's going to be one of those I mean Trey Turner is one of the best players in the world period. But for him to be the guy to flex the muscles to bring the huge power.
0:11:30,I think that has surprised some folks to to full count now three and two on the twenty twenty two season Trey Turner twenty one home runs one hundred RBI eyes.
0:11:45,in a hundred and sixty games guy that plays every single day. Maybe the new feature for Trey Turner's game is upping those home run count career high 28 in a single season. Muto fouls that went out of play.
0:12:0,He's in a great stadium to up those home runs too. Yeah you could be coming for a new career high this year. It's funny Team USA's hit 11 home runs more than any other team in this world baseball classic. Turner's got five.
0:12:15,nobody else has more than one he's the only player for Team USA who's hit more than one and he's hit five of them pound for pound one of the strongest guys in that team great turn three two no Muto blind drive
0:12:30,five base hit left field. This is a game seven so we'll have to see how both managers want to work their way through this game. It's only the.
0:12:45,second inning left handed hitter Cedric Mullins homered against Cuba in the semifinal win he takes ball one more than the ones that the managers will say OK he's had enough.
0:13:0,Want to pitch Mullins takes a strike kind of that get it in breaking ball Japan's not going to wait around if if he gets into more trouble.
0:13:15,that's a good slider right there a little bit of a split
0:13:30,the one two to Mullins. Perfect pitch right on the outside. He's soft good pitch calling.
0:13:45,And the umpire Lance Barksdale I think it's worth pointing out runner at first two down Tim Anderson ninth place hitter for Team USA takes a breaking ball high that's the slower curve ball there there's some umpires who if you make that was a strike and Lance Barksdale.
0:14:0,called it strike three. Real Muto the runner at first Anderson on the ground up the middle of his head. Muto will stop at second.
0:14:15,And now Team USA has a chance to make this much more than just a one run inning doesn't look like it with the Dickey Curry Ama.
0:14:30,Obviously that goes without saying go in the bullpen. That's something we probably won't see from Team USA Japan a little more free to use their bullpen.
0:14:45,liberally to walk to Al Buki Betts swings at that pitch and hits a fly ball to left field. Yoshida will make the catch short of the warning tracks and went over there and did really transform his career.
0:15:0,pitch with Murakami crushes one into the second deck tie game.
0:15:15,David takes one swing. That happened last night. The drive to left center to win it. Sees another fastball tonight. 
0:15:30,"Murakami is no surprise to big games and big swings, the two-time MVP has come up huge for Japan. You want to answer back? There it is right there. Oh my goodness, was that ball crushed or what? 430"
0:15:45,at two feet one hundred fifteen miles per hour off the bat. He knew it was it was a no doubt like I like to say. Big time swing. So with that it's one to one.
0:16:0,All it takes with these sluggers is one swing and the point.
0:16:15,But back to Murakami just briefly through his first advance of the game last night. He looked like a lost soul. He was a shell of himself and he came up in that huge crowd.
0:16:30,spot late in the game delivered the game winning hit and the swing week about that as he was thinking about bunting he was situation he talked about it after the game and you know Corey Yama you got to give him credit as the manager here for Japan said no no no we know
0:16:45,I don't know what you can do with the bat we believe in you go ahead and you know it just show manager understanding the moment and the player he had at the plate. Yeah.
0:17:0,that's going to be a little bit more difficult for him to handle. He's got a lot of things outside he out out told him to not but Joe Hilton not in a mean way not in a more jealous way it's just that he's been so good for Japan he needed some protection he felt like he was the guy.
0:17:15,"that said OK I'm the one that's going to be by your side doing this whole thing. We're here in a game 7 situation. So 1 to 1, go bottom of the second."
0:17:30,to one to Yamada. Now in this badly it's three and one let's go down to JP Murakami was the dominant story in Japan last year in the pitcher who was his teammate with the cold swallows told me last year that when he walked.
0:17:45,by the newsstands he said quote more or less all the front pages are his picture well last night that came true again i'm sure and this morning mitaka morikami two-time
0:18:0,reigning Central League MVP monster power numbers 3 1 2 it is now Wednesday morning in Tokyo.
0:18:15,that you watch with a country watching the interest the passion for baseball in that country off the charts. Samurai Japan as they call this national team three and two.
0:18:30,ball Tony of course in the big leagues more comedy still playing in Japan maybe one day he'll come to Major League Baseball.
0:18:45,baseball but those are the two dominant forces in Japanese baseball with the long ball.
0:19:0,Three two and that one is driven to right field Betts will glide over and catch it for a number one. This was last night his teammates.
0:19:15,with the occult swallows in their clubhouse use the camera work. They're a little excited there. I'm sure they can't wait to see their teammate come home and celebrate an incredible moment.
0:19:30,The shortstop in eighth place hitter bottom pinky finger right hand pinky wrapped up he flips that line drive into left field that's going to be a hit to a broken finger or not. Genda gets an opposite.
0:19:45,field single and Japan has two on with one out pitch Mark DeRosa now starting to talk things over in the dugout a run across two more hits and he petted his pitching coach on the phone we may see some bullpen.
0:20:0,and activity pitch ball to the ninth place to the catcher Nakamura more for his defense but capable three four six in this world baseball classic he understands his role he's not thinking.
0:20:15,he's got a slug right here he's just thinking of put the ball in play. Who's at the top of the line up. Garcia deciding he may need him in this second inning.
0:20:30,tonight to a slow bouncer toward third it kicks foul. One thing Nakamura likes to do is pull the baseball he on top of the dish and he's doing he's looking for one thing and that's to pull the baseball.
0:20:45,and lead runner Okamoto not great speed. He's the first baseman at second. Not a real fast runner at the plate to one and got it inside to him too. That's the pitch you want to. It's uncomfortable. You have to make sure.
0:21:0,that you get it inside how you open up windows. Kelly's two to. It almost reminds me of Justin Turner. He stays more even.
0:21:15,with it a lot harder to hit that pitch inside harder 3 2 that is a ball outside he walked in and that's huge that's the ninth place hitter now the bars new park coming up and we'll see what Mark DeRosa wants to do.
0:21:30,to do I just don't know if Luke is warmed enough this could be a meeting from real Muto and company just to stall for an extra minute some more pitches.
0:21:45,and it's a great singer also just starting to get loose out there they're bringing the right matchup and loop if that's the case.
0:22:0,Looking for a double play and not necessarily looking for a strikeout coming out. So that was just to buy an extra moment and the USA manager is going to make the pitching change. It's only the second inning but this is loaded one out.
0:22:15,about who has become a hero in Japan first pitch and he squared around like he might but I think he was just taking a pitch there and Lou got the call strike one.
0:22:30,What a spot for Aaron Luke. One strike pitch. And it's strike two. That's a good strike right there and that's got sinks in.
0:22:45,that's very hard to time up if your new bar right now you're in just protection mode Kondo on deck then we would see Ohtani if Japan's rally continues. Here's the 0 2.
0:23:0,Newport breaks his back slow roller to first base Goldschmidt only plays the first and Luke just got there to get the out on the play. Okamoto comes tossed by Goldschmidt but he's so deceptive. He's so good that you get a lot of soft contact.
0:23:15,A moment when you need to double play kind of worked in the favors of Japanese hitters and the value of putting the ball in play in a two strike count to get the run home now a chance for more with Kim skate condo he takes a strike.
0:23:30,first up in Miami this is a big spot a piece it could make it four to one well off the outside.
0:23:45,He's so athletic in the box. A lot of these Japanese hitters are very athletic but he's always moving. He's always got a lot of rhythm.
0:24:0,rhythm and his low first movement and then he just continues to wiggle and takes a strike located wanted to that's a good pitch who has been missing with.
0:24:15,this fastball in the inner third to the left handers know he's got a good slider let the action work
0:24:30,Here's the one to that one is hit down the left field line foul not by much if you're Lou you want to throw that fastball you want to throw the fastball in nothing but a fastball.
0:24:45,nothing away we'll try it again
0:25:0,He did come way inside Kondo tried to hold up and did manage to hold up but the ball hit the bat foul ball. Very scary situation obviously to her team you said you've got to have guts if you're J.T. Ramone to the.
0:25:15,batter loads of bases for Ohtani and Team USA does not want that Luke was so trying to dig deep here.
0:25:30,And yet Team USA out of this big second inning jam the one to that one is popped up into center field. Mike Trout is there for a slider splitter since mid.
0:25:45,in the 90s his first pitch in this championship game to Mike Tritt his strike one the 0 1 tip and it got a piece.
0:26:0,the catcher on to Mike Trout has been relatively the state's lineup in Phoenix in pool play to get here to have a chance to win this championship. Yeah.
0:26:15,team on to the trout not close. Well there's a slider right there.
0:26:30,especially late early and late has been in on him the one to the trout and he got it swinging very new drops out of a table just a good pitch right there.
0:26:45,because that was nasty. So now Paul Goldschmidt he takes the breaking ball in the dirt for ball one. Goldschmidt struck out his first time up that was against the starter Imaniga.
0:27:0,and one on deck and then Schwarzer would follow. That one is high in the air.
0:27:15,way up there coming in hard Yoshida from left field toward the line to down a clean normal clean ending top a guy who can come in and start.
0:27:30,here in the third fresh hopefully give him a couple innings two or three innings Max and I know Merrill kept winning Aaron Luke though doing an excellent job because that could have gotten ugly for Team USA.
0:27:45,today with the top of the order up extra run after the home run ball one to Nolan Arenado he fouls it out of play it's one and one you can tell the action on that fastball today.
0:28:0,On Togo it's gotten though anything goes he's thrown that good split that good fastball in with a little ride. I would think split here. But mess with it.
0:28:15,Now you can double up on it or take the adjustments of Nolan and say hey I got to trust my fastball here but Nolan he's too smart he'll make the adjustment. So goes to one pitch.
0:28:30,Go no with especially these counts fastball counts. Here's the three one ball for inside did not throw him a fastball. It's a two hour walk. That's a clear message.
0:28:45,first on Schwerber's part of he's on deck. Hey we want to go. We want to go against you. So power forty six home run season last year for Kyle Schwerber goes after the first pitch though pops it up.
0:29:0,Will it be playable in the net just beyond the reach of the catcher Nakamura or he took a really good and all the big league baseball had more home runs last year than the guy at the plate right now.
0:29:15,one no matter where he's played
0:29:30,and he'll sit on it if it's a good pitch if it's a hanging pitch he may have the lead to one.
0:29:45,And close but called a ball Togo got the first. Trey Turner waiting hoping 3 1 Schwarzer went after a high fastball that might have been ball for.
0:30:0,He got away with a second. Almost like a right smile from Shosei Togo. Arnado is going to take off a two down. There he goes three to pitch his ball for not close.
0:30:15,back to opportunity to tie the
0:30:30,or who knows maybe much more
0:30:45,First pitch to Turner way outside and a great save by Nakamura.
0:31:0,Here's the one oh and he was caught in between right there. He's just so good at simplifying it real and this at bat.
0:31:15,The 1 1 bounces it foul wanted to mean to strike situation and he hit the grand slam against Venezuela the moment of this whole two and a half year.
0:31:30,of the tournament in a two strike you go back to that at bat for home runs in his last seven at bats.
0:31:45,Here's the one to not this time the splitter strike a pitcher Kyle Freeland immediately has to face Tony.
0:32:0,bounces a breaking ball for ball one third pitcher of the game already for Team USA bottom of the third Freeland to pitch against Great Britain through three innings in pool play back in Phoenix.
0:32:15,Got the call there it's one and one. We know one thing he is. Just. Playing for the Rockies. Tony Swington misses one or two. I talked to him earlier.
0:32:30,earlier Freeland asked how much funny leaveable tough task here's his one two off the outside to see what Ohtani said yesterday after the.
0:32:45,game about taking batting practice. He doesn't do it on the field during the big league season. He just wanted Team Mexico to see him take some swings. We'll count here three and two.
0:33:0,most particular junior. Here's three to pitch Ohtani takes.
0:33:15,Going to the swing. Was a well executed pitch now he misses inside to Yoshida.
0:33:30,apparently had quite the pregame speech Ohtani did in the locker room before the game he was the guy to get up and address team Japan.
0:33:45,"Quote on quote, let's stop admiring them. If you admire them, you can't surpass them. We came here to surpass them, to reach the top for one day. Let's just throw all that away, the admirations."
0:34:0,And just think about winning. I think that would get me going. That's ball four to Yoshida. So after Freeland struck out Otani he gives up the four pitch walk we've seen the walk.
0:34:15,It's going to be a big play for Japan these last couple of nights and now it just feels like all just a throw. We'll see Freeland to the plate and first pitch swing could be to Anderson to second one.
0:34:30,Trying to go in on him with fastballs inside see J.T. understands that it turns on one they went inside and up without it just tells me he was sitting fastball.
0:34:45,while he was sitting fastball in Togo works for the wind up and his breaking balls a little bit low it's one in one.
0:35:0,Muto had the great quote the other day and I think speaking for everybody in that dugout wanted to how could you possibly rather be in spring training than have.
0:35:15,chance to play in these games almost like the recruitment for the next World Baseball Classic has already started. Oh yeah. On to a slow roller hit foul. Mike tried already said I'm in.
0:35:30,Twenty twenty six count. For America is going to want to play next time around and he thinks the recruitment on the pitching side will be intense. Yeah. One to now one line to shortstop and caught there.
0:35:45,By Genda who had a really good fastball and a really good split especially in Turner's at bat. Here's Mullins the splitter for strike one like that one. If you strike out Trey Turner we're going to highlight you.
0:36:0,It's a little carrot for every pitcher for Japan right now the way Trey Turner's swinging. You know one Mullins pops it up and it's going to make it back into the seats or at least into the net.
0:36:15,and it's going to I think for me is the ability to get ahead of him likes to get a lot of soft contact but that that those first two pitches in the batter so crucial for Togo he lands him for strike.
0:36:30,he can go to work through the split Mullins did a good job Cedric Mullins who's really turned into a star for the Baltimore Orioles playing.
0:36:45,last night an excellent hitter called the ball knock him he came up ready to throw to two Mullins fights it off.
0:37:0,right field side but you talk defense and left field spot last night Japan was just sending one line drive after another out there. I think he bought himself another splitter here to to think that would go in on him.
0:37:15,Let's see that one flying towards left center field and it's going to be caught slicing back to Yoshida to down while looking up into the lights. But he made the catch two down. Here's Tim Anderson had to be.
0:37:30,base at his first time up swing just through the fastball. Tim breaking ball hitter. Got to be careful with Tim Anderson any breaking balls. He's going after him. Oh one he went after that one.
0:37:45,To right center field and fairly deep big part of this championship and I know the undercoming in the Dominican Republic and their lineup stacked pitching depth Venezuela a great team Puerto Rico all the history and the star.
0:38:0,power on that team but yeah. Through it all is Kyle Freeland back to work in a swing and a high fly ball left center field a deep Mullins at the wall it's gone.
0:38:15,against Oklahoma the other surprise. Past five seasons thirty plus home runs. We know the power is there.
0:38:30,in Ocamoto one hundred and sixty four home runs in that span. He got a good pitch to hit right there. Boy oh boy he did not miss it.
0:38:45,He knew he was gone as soon as he left his bat. Yamada pops it up right center field. That's calls off Mike Trout. This is not an easy home run hitter's ballpark.
0:39:0,Well you're right that was crushed. Now Genda takes a strike careful with a good push on here try to run it towards Tim Anderson. Anderson's playing deep if he can get it by the pitcher.
0:39:15,but he hit it foul off his foot so it's only two once one nothing USA now it's 3 1 Japan
0:39:30,Speaking of defense manager for Japan and Dickey Kuriyama at the play right here. So skate again. Not just the greatest shortstop right now. He called him the greatest shortstop in Japanese baseball history.
0:39:45,defensively defensively five straight Golden Glove awards was given to the best defender in his league at his position slashes that one foul and that's what Japan has always been able to do.
0:40:0,but it do mistakes they're gonna hit the right cuts they're gonna play the right defense they're gonna run the right bases they're gonna make you beat them but beat them the right way they're not gonna give you out
0:40:15,to two off the outside Correa Walsh Rojas kind of falafel. We do have measurements to get those strikes out swinging.
0:40:30,for baseball last 37 way above and be wow that's incredible and we saw it make a spectacular over the shoulder catch last night's win over the shoulder catch.
0:40:45,match that added up to give Japan a chance to come from behind and win the ninth place hitter Nakamura takes ball one one thing I've noticed all now with two heads but with one.
0:41:0,Tells you how sure they are of their hands on the ground the short are not I was going to cut it off this guy has a really good splitter gets a lot of swings and misses on the fast ball big chopper to throw.
0:41:15,third going to be a tough play the throw low and got him at first I don't know. The intentional bounce and perfect to first base team USA is going to challenge it was bank.
0:41:30,Yeah I mean these guys were great all the way around. OK. Even with the microphone not functioning we know what they're looking at and it shouldn't take long.
0:41:45,I didn't think they would take that long.
0:42:0,played by Mookie Takahashi throws and a fastball just a little bit high. There's the one oh.
0:42:15,Just outside again to look that's again good size lead over at first base. Oh and he didn't throw the fastball he threw that split.
0:42:30,the quality of pitching we're seeing here. Yeah this country trial still ahead though to one pitch on away foul to the backstop. So he followed the split with ninety seven and that's what the.
0:42:45,in the zone here's the two to and that one comes.
0:43:0,He's way inside. It's right here because anything goes it's not just a fastball count. His pitch pitches a splitter.
0:43:15,He does not and the ball is pulled foul it was that splitter the at bat goes the more advantage it leads to Mike Trout.
0:43:30,He's seen that splitter three or four times. He's seen that fastball in 97 98. He's too bitter He looks dangerous he does
0:43:45,another three to the pitch Swanson missed he got it with that nasty splitter the 20 year old in a championship game against the best hitter in the world.
0:44:0,He's been the biggest eye opener in this tournament. But. It's not over for him yet he's got to get through at least one more maybe two maybe more.  Outside with the fastball.
0:44:15,baseball and Nolan Arnauto the returning players from that championship team six years ago.
0:44:30,1 0 swings through the fastball dropped by Nakamura but. That's Stan put. We've seen some of the best hitters have very awkward swings and Mike Trout.
0:44:45,now Goldsmith and it tells you the fastball how explosive it is one and one long pause maybe
0:45:0,that helped freeze the runner Goldschmidt took a big swing fouled it back. I would think of Mookie at some point here. He's going to test it a little bit unsure right now. You got to pick the right pitches.
0:45:15,Oriental Civic Academy fans that guy has she won too through the split he found stood and was blocked to that state down and
0:45:30,and you have power at the plate. He already struck out Mike Trout. Now trying to get Goldschmidt. The 2-2. Strike three! Fetch ball frozen.
0:45:45,everything he's got with two pitches very impressive all in lengths to swing first pitcher gets a good pitch.
0:46:0,he's he's looking to pull he's looking to slug first pitch of all your take right there USA.
0:46:15,Here's his 1 0 missed outside with a fastball to it. I'm just so amazed by their delivery and how they can throw so hard and kind of pause their their follow through.
0:46:30,the first time in the world 97 98 the vicious splitter make some of the best hitters in the world look like they've looked in the city. He's a starter in Japan. He's got the stuff of a closer.
0:46:45,Here's his to own that one is lined in the left field that's a base hit for Nolan Arnauto. One hop to Yoshida Betts will stop at second. He's just so consistent.
0:47:0,consistent that is the classic Nolan Arnauto swing Takahashi on the previous bat he missed a couple of fastballs that he wanted back. They baited him with some splitters but this is a totally different.
0:47:15,different animal in Takahashi. Great chance for Schwarzer though two on two out. He takes a little bit high ball one. That's where they've gone. They've gone up.
0:47:30,up the ladder even counts more fastballs up in the zone and he's lurking in Ohtani trying to stay loose it's been a grind of a half inning.
0:47:45,Off the inside to an O. Some good takes from the USA hitters in this inning because these pitchers are these are not big misses and for a big hit.
0:48:0,And who knows maybe a big fly Don't take a shot here Here's the 2-0 In the dirt and through the splitter And it's 3-0 Well Again
0:48:15,the same situation here you get trade to he's the guy here though with two outs you know I know you've got Turner behind but it's a fastball count for ninety five percent of the time.
0:48:30,We'll see if it is here three and. Takahashi Schwerber swings three and it's a fly ball center field in the ballpark. New bar for our number three lead Japan is preparing for the late innings with one.
0:48:45,one of the best pitchers in the world top of the order here in the bottom of the fifth Japan Hardy and Lars Newport that lasted bat was one where he found a way to get another run home against a left hand.
0:49:0,reliever put the ball in play and a two strike count. At that point it made it two to one and Luke got the ground ball it's just you're throwing those sinker ball there's more than not on left handers you're going to get the soft contact a new bar hit that one hard but.
0:49:15,a pop up in the right field Mookie Betts one away and this was just a little tardy on the fastball. He's refreshed refresh refresh. He wants to see that pitch that he missed because I mean I think the point you make is an.
0:49:30,important one you really got to trust your guy 3 0 with as hot as Trey Turner has been but you trust him to swing at the right pitch 3 0 and he did I mean look we've seen him in the past this guy and.
0:49:45,at any given moment right he'll he'll change looking for and you've had the right guy I mean sure would you like to get Turner with bases loaded but it's a totally different animal of what is the good of should have would have I don't I don't mind.
0:50:0,and even just runs getting a fastball right down the middle against tough right handed pitcher strike to condo like I think you put it you've got to live with it.
0:50:15,with the result not to live with it I think if it's a seventh or eighth inning it's a little different right now why not three one pitch Condo takes ball for so that's a one hour walk with Otani coming up.
0:50:30,pitchers well at your point at thinking you're going to let this guy beat you in a championship game.
0:50:45,Well in the prior at bat Freeland really was on on the slider the cutter not too many fastballs.
0:51:0,Johnny chased one that's the first fastball he's seen from that might free Freeland up a little bit to go after him snaps a throw to first condo. He's got to be careful.
0:51:15,You got to be able to throw in and make sure it's a dangerous situation to play with.
0:51:30,here a little soft here take by Tony seemed to see that pitch pretty well.
0:51:45,the play could be fastballs back in but you've highlighted show hey he can't beat you wants that fastball again.
0:52:0,to one pitch Ohtani got jammed hits the ground ball Anderson there to make the play and throw out Ohtani and you've got to give a lot of credit to Friedman right there with Jane the slider and Freeland saying it was. I think you're right to point out it takes a little gut.
0:52:15,that's J.J. Ruto is one of the great catch a Kim off to go at the pitch you want. That's what you're supposed to do. It's you're you're the pitcher you're throwing the pitch but. I love it. I mean that that's just if it tells you anything about Freeland and who.
0:52:30,he is and the grit and desire he has to pitch for Team USA it's right there in that at bat. But now he's getting on that ground ball condo move to seconds runner in scoring position Japan already ahead three.
0:52:45,three to one she takes ball to he's he's he's looked he's seen everything we talked about it yesterday how he's it's again got to be very.
0:53:0,to be careful here with Yoshida. Kyle Freeland a check at second really a long look back there. She takes a strike. Hey there's really no break in this.
0:53:15,for China or Japan and all these guys do actually when you have that runner out there in scoring position that's when they go to work they make it very hard on the pitcher.
0:53:30,one to one foul that went back out of play they don't have the top to bottom power for Mark DeRosa if he gets out of this inning do you bring him back up for the bottom of the six and Freeland.
0:53:45,He's got a very healthy bullpen right now and starting a clean inning I would think he would go to it here's the two to she'd a topper right back to the mound Cal Freeland has it and he throws him out.
0:54:0,We saw both Darvish and Ohtani out there first pitch as low to Trey Turner. Yeah he relies a lot on off-speed pitches and. Has hit another homerun tonight his fifth of the tournament.
0:54:15,fastball got the strike and the knees one and one get enough full on three miles an hour at least to plant the seed. Yeah one.
0:54:30,one turner off the end of the bat to left field you know she got one away seen a lot of these American hitters really wanting to.
0:54:45,for the baseball if Japan plays it right.
0:55:0,pitch to real Muto is a strike. Now is it likely that they'll only have to go through those big hitters one more time the bullpen to do so. Real Muto one for two at the 
0:55:15,close one on one team USA has six hits Japan has four hits but two home runs for Japan.
0:55:30,This would be interesting to see what the plan is in terms of the timing of Shohei Ohtani and the fact that he went down there now another pitch dropped but the call made by Lance Parksdale it's one and two
0:55:45,second to last out one to just try to think along with the manager how it's going to play out.
0:56:0,It's just complicated Ohtani has not pitched in relief since twenty sixteen in any setting. So in terms of balancing his job as a hitter and also trying to find a way to get him ready to pitch it's delicate. I would I would think they would.
0:56:15,You want to give a tiny a clean inning. Yeah. I would think also will be a guy who's warming up in case if Ito gets in trouble. That would be my guess too. Maybe show hey targeted for.
0:56:30,for the seventh. Yes the seventh. It just depends how much time he needs to warm up. I mean you know most starters take a little bit longer than bullpen guys on the ground the third and picked clean by Murakami. Does he need.
0:56:45,two innings does he need an inning and a half to get ready that's that's kind of the question mark we don't really know correct and again it's just speculation for us but I'm only thinking that
0:57:0,His manager sent him out there now. So it kind of makes you think. That as opposed to saving him say for the ninth inning which was some speculation coming in. Maybe he's going to pitch a little earlier than that.
0:57:15,to see Cedric Mullins all I know is we got the next oh my goodness world baseball classic championship game tonight.
0:57:30,one and one twenty five years old very sharp two and one
0:57:45,golf Topgolf. But here he is to 1 out all it's to a 2. Oh he's got the count 1 down lift it in the Cole 부랑크
0:58:0,That's a good fastball. That would be something if he broke it out here wouldn't it. I don't think so too too. I don't either. He struck him out point ninety eight with it and they only slugged one seventy eight.
0:58:15,This is that guy who get on top of you with his fastball will finish you off with that breaking ball. Got to be careful with this guy the big big power and a breaking ball to jump ahead on one against our economy jump on first pitch heaters both times both at bats.
0:58:30,He's had tonight a home run and has grounded into a double play big shift on for more coming fastball off the outside.
0:58:45,Trey Turner's the guy who's gone out really to play shallow right field.
0:59:0,that makes me think I was wrong about the way they're trying to plot out the last few innings maybe Ohtani just want to watch the game.
0:59:15,game from a different spot maybe Kami fouls it out of play make Mark DeRosa think a little bit about using his bench again.
0:59:30,and we don't know exactly how even you Darvish is allowed to be used. I will think one thing.
0:59:45,got it that's a good change up right there. But if you're going to go with Darvish Darby fair to assume. Come on and we'll keep our eyes out there.
1:0:0,that team Japan bullpen. Meanwhile Okamoto who has hit a home run in this championship game he's two for two he scored two of the three runs so he's having a big night takes the breaking ball for a strike.
1:0:15,He's had a great career in Japan five seasons with 30 plus home runs. We know about the power The old one Go no
1:0:30,the one one that one is hit
1:0:45,It's going to slice though and make it back into the seats.
1:1:0,teams Marquez and Champ and Champ to Chad see if they can inspire Volcano here's the 1 2
1:1:15,strikeout with the breaking ball that's a good slider right there fastball though finished him off with a slider so two outs Jason Adams come into this game looks great. That's a suit.
1:1:30,Oh Yamada veteran player fastball high ball one something about his leg kick though man.
1:1:45,take one I've been very surprised by Japanese fans I mean we see the Budweiser deck over there is it it's always gonna be a big game you know we've seen it twice to get verbs and it's starting to seem clear here right now the courthouse Steyer may be over
1:2:0,It's filled completely they've shown up missed with a breaking ball outside.
1:2:15,the bottom part of the order. I would think you'll challenge him here with a fastball. I would think so.
1:2:30,is to one pitch he didn't he threw the breaking ball and fooled him tells you how reliable he feels about that pitch with the slider mornings we're hitting in the low two hundreds.
1:2:45,and just 178 off of it. Jason Adam ready and the two to pitch down and away with the slider again.
1:3:0,Well I mean I agree with you that the principle is sort of the same but he's he trusts that breaking ball big time whatever it is he needs to throw a strike.
1:3:15,to forecast full count three and two here's the pitch its phone for you walked in seen
1:3:30,over in this tournament to our walks really hot Yamada's got enough speed to wear especially on this fast turf here in Miami if Gendry slashes one down the line could get one in the gap that two hour walk could turn into an extra.
1:3:45,to run so skate again a short stop in eighth place hitter one for two tonight.
1:4:0,runner goes pitch taken very high real Muto's throw a slide safe and second. So that's big that walk essentially turns into a two hour extra base.
1:4:15,That's why two while walks are dangerous especially with a guy like him. Genda chance to just flip a base hit anywhere and add to the league. This is when he'll make you work right here and get the.
1:4:30,Want to know the count and I'm looking back to second now throws slider and misses high. The one thing about Ganda is they've been going hard on him that he's understanding that as he's hit some balls to the left side of the field.
1:4:45,Big hole out out there in left field. The two pitch and tops it foul. That's a good change up. Very good change up right there.
1:5:0,team USA all the power on their offensive side they're feeling that they can't fall another run behind two and one here's the pitch.
1:5:15,way outside sitting soft here. He's been throwing it.
1:5:30,Here's the three one that is ball for some back to back walks and that was an easy take two on for Japan with a bullpen the last inning but it's at least possible that his team would have a chance to win.
1:5:45,the spot's going to come up here in the sixth if this rally continues so also back in show a little league baseball in a championship setting.
1:6:0,to on to out a visit to the mound from Andy Pettitte the pitching coach now of breaking ball that goes over the head of Nakamura for ball one.
1:6:15,it's a thrilling night's game Nakamura has already walked in this game. You got the leadoff hitter on deck.
1:6:30,the 1 0 pitch got the call there that's a much better slider right there on Darvish to his favor they've taken a longer time in this inning.
1:6:45,Yeah he's had a lot of time now it's hard for us to know we're not down there but he's had a lot of time to get ready. The one one pitch way outside ball to.
1:7:0,a pitch gotta find the strike
1:7:15,pitch that is inside ball three he's just all over the place he's lost it he's lost command of his fastball he's lost command of his slider his go to pitch.
1:7:30,I just think at this point you go with what you know best shaken as real Muto go through goes through the signs he wants to go through him again. He's lived and died in this game.
1:7:45,that's going to tie his whole career with this slider. I would think the sliders what's coming excellent speed on the bases for Japan to one to out bottom six a 3 1 count. Here's the pitch. It is not.
1:8:0,even close to the backstop ball for so with two outs and nobody on Jason Adam has walked the bases loaded even close.
1:8:15,I mean one issue for Mark DeRosa and Team USA is there there are not a lot of pitchers that have the green light to come in in an existing inning. Almost everybody has that restriction where OK you can use it but.
1:8:30,But you've got to start it in him. Ken. And meanwhile. Jason Adam. Can not be a good feeling maybe Andy Pettitte can spot something and help him.
1:8:45,so far 0 4 3 but with a run batted in bases loaded two down against Adam and he finds the strike zone with that first pitch.
1:9:0,That's a really good change of right there boy that just it kind of takes everybody's breath. OK now we can relax. New for the first player born outside Japan to play for Team Japan in the World Baseball.
1:9:15,classic in a huge moment the 0 1 one is up high same pitch different result one and one and one thing that Lawrence Newport is known for in the.
1:9:30,and big leagues his patience he typically makes you find the strike zone. Those are the runners a walk forces in a run. Here's the one one that is a strike.
1:9:45,with the breaking ball in there one or two that's a good fast ball that's a good slider right there. Huge moment in the game.
1:10:0,this postseason went back to
1:10:15,I would like something soft once again you really got to trust JT Romo doing this at this point really got to believe in him
1:10:30,miles an hour Price gotta be down for the bases full. Another one to pitch way outside of the fastball.
1:10:45,It's just not these are huge misses so many of these just a ball out of the hand here it comes.
1:11:0,New bar fly ball right field Mookie Betts is there it was not a McNeil takes outside. From out of all one what a great
1:11:15,you're going to have out of your your bench he's a batting champion Mark DeRosa feels bad he just hasn't been able to use him that much. They've seen a ton of left handed pitching that was close but called the ball zone.
1:11:30,and a walk would be a huge play by himself a fastball here you would think so top of the order up next and he gets a fastball but not close three you know seventh inning it's usually.
1:11:45,where you win or lose a game. Well and we saw the green one there will not be a he'll be taken here. Down to.
1:12:0,a four pitch walk Jeff McNeil. Foreign position USA 0 4 5 7 left Japan over four with seven left. Somebody's got to come through. Mookie Betts takes strike one.
1:12:15,So Ota got the call that time this inning very important inning for both teams. The 0 1 Mookie swings and misses. That's a good split.
1:12:30,That's the split he relies on when he gets on top of the head handed hitter's back leg. So he's ahead of Mookie Betts Owen to runner at first nobody out and very high with a fast ball.
1:12:45,and that's just to move over the next pitch set up that splitter wanted to he throws Betts line drive and hit just hit it too hard past the reach
1:13:0,The U.S.A. has two on nobody out with Mike Trout coming up. We talk about it with a double. Since then he has struck out twice. What a chance here. Speed on the bases nobody out.
1:13:15,strikeout I think it hit the bat. Oh what a great for Joe the first base America's captain. Can he come through.
1:13:30,that's been all over the place here. The 0 1 trout fly drive right field. Condo leaps forward to make the catch that one almost fooled him.
1:13:45,spin on the ball a huge first out to get through away from the lights good play so not out of it though absolutely not now USA 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position Paul Goldschmidt comes out
1:14:0,up here he's 0 4 3 2 on now one out Goldschmidt over top the splitter that splitter.
1:14:15,Maybe starting to picture. Swing and a miss over to. Got him to chase. All day he's. Still haven't had a hit with a runner in scoring position.
1:14:30,position on either side of that three home runs in this game. A home run here would put Team USA back ahead down three one the O2 is on the ground is short.
1:14:45,first got David Bettner for Team USA the American team had a great opportunity in the top of the seventh and the big time pitching got through it. So it's still three to one fourth appearance of this tournament for Bettner.
1:15:0,Pirates closer in the big leagues challenged him with a fastball there. Big wheel stays in the gates that are he needs a zero here.
1:15:15,right now but no better guy to do it than Bednar. He's been outstanding. Slash foul. It's one of two just two hits in this world and to the eighth. I and the fact that he has continued to throw would make me think that.
1:15:30,and that's true Kanske Kondo 1 2 pitch he fouls it off to the left that's a good fastball at ninety seven miles an hour right there they have just missed the big.
1:15:45,Hit tonight they've had chances. Eight of them. Want to. A little pop up are not all alone on the left side. No problem for him one way. Now Tommy will.
1:16:0,hit after running some wind sprints back and forth from the dugout to the bullpen. It's just truly no and a night where he may do both hit and come out.
1:16:15,of the bullpen not just as a starter it's a little complicated. Ohtani takes ball one fastballs inside has been has been the go to against.
1:16:30,to show a tiny that Nard throws and misses with a breaking ball to and oh that's just wanting to overthrow that breaking ball right there. That's all that is.
1:16:45,I wouldn't be surprised if a fastball comes here Fastball! Foul back
1:17:0,a little tick underneath it. Big shift on for Ohtani if he wants a butt hit it's available. To one he drives that one foul off to the.
1:17:15,to the left another fastball got him late got him late on that fastball. This is great kind of mouse game. So much fun. And again the pressure to keep this a two run game.
1:17:30,sports you make one mistake to this guy and it can be for one that NARS to to that is off the outside. I would think if you score one more run in your Japan.
1:17:45,you may not see Ohtani close it out full cap now the 3-2
1:18:0,Ohtani hits it hard and a diving staff from his day is the throw not in time Ohtani big strong and he's too fast.
1:18:15,and even without the microphone the call safe the place stands it's the bottom of the seventh inning and really no real talk of Yoshida.
1:18:30,considering how well he's been swinging the bat and it's not out of the question that Ohtani could try to steal a bag.
1:18:45,we take a look with fastball
1:19:0,It has been I think I just think if you're a tiny you're staying put right now at first base get that hold of your sheet of fastball you took a chance right there one one hit and run type of swing.
1:19:15,nothing no no it was not. Here's the one one back that again was a big healthy cut and Yoshida's talking to himself base. There's a big hole at first base.
1:19:30,There's a rollover Tony's going to third now you've got first and third with one out that's troubles you've got to stay hard with him if you throw them throwing the breaking balls they got to be they got to be off the plate and away they are overloaded on that.
1:19:45,inside but still wanted to Bednar pitches different kind of swing different pitch type stay alive it's wanted to change up right there.
1:20:0,You know one thing Yoshida has been really good at swinging the bridge inning I got I like to call out of hitters understand that they can get aggressive.
1:20:15,was real close to another possible it cost strike three two and two that one is hit on the ground to flip to turn the throw to first in plenty of 30 a little more.
1:20:30,but there's also a lot of big time stuff. Who's back in the bullpen and climbing back on top of the mound. First pitch from Darvish wasn't particularly close ball one and then offered the starts.
1:20:45,For both leagues in Japan and Major League Baseball. Never pitched in relief since coming to the big leagues are not to center field. New bars there one away.
1:21:0,Throw you a heater right down the middle. He's always going to be nibbling. Now Kyle Schwarzer 0 4 2 strike one on a lot of backwards pitching where you think you have a fastball you won't get it where you think.
1:21:15,I think you're going to get breaking ball you'll get the fastball he throws this is outside one of the moments of this game was the last time the couch were.
1:21:30,two on two out of three oh county got the green light and he flied out I think we know though he he's hit he slugged up garbage in the past two homers off Team USA running out of.
1:21:45,out in this championship game. Darvish is to one Schwarzer fouls the breaking ball back and a good example there of what you're talking about.
1:22:0,Now it's 2 and 2 to Kyle Schwarmer. Here comes. Schwarmer blasts one foul. My goodness. That's what I wanted to see with a 3 0 green light. 
1:22:15,and obviously but just the yonderisms to put to Darvish throws Schwerber pulls that one foul on the ground this time.
1:22:30,by facing garbage is the longer you go into the bat the more comfortable you get with the spin which is rolling. Just go with him all the way through the end of the game. We'll see that guy lurking that guy.
1:22:45,Is definitely lurking to to Schwerber hanging in there. The foul ball. I think when you look at this game. But this be the eighth pitch that Kyle Schwerber has seen.
1:23:0,pitch Darvish throws Schwarzenegger lights it down the right field line but again just a little too quick. But you're seeing the swings they're getting better.
1:23:15,better and better and better. He's just got a simple dose up for Schwarzer Garbage is down. Now the ninth pitch of the event and a curveball that one is blasted foul.
1:23:30,one Andy Golland Saturday night at 7 For you who can execute that's it. Tenth pitch and the at bat here
1:23:45,field it is gone into the second deck he wanted it back.
1:24:0,"The longer the at-bat, the more hope for Team USA Schwarzer cuts the lead What a swing, what an at-bat He got the splitter, he was set up for the splitter"
1:24:15,And Schwerver did not miss it. Why did that bad what a swing. Ten pitch at bat four hundred and thirty plus feet. One run game. That's right.
1:24:30,that just lit this ballpark up totally has changed the feel of this game.
1:24:45,And the dirt got it. Now their home run leader. Trey Turner fouls it back to the backstop. Rocky's excited. Wanted to.
1:25:0,Turner pokes one right center field that's going to be a hit. Trey Turner's got speed he's going to slam on the brakes as Newkirk got to the ball quickly. But one of the fastest players in this game is a board as the time.
1:25:15,game run he's going to test them all right you can definitely run on against your best stuff bring it and that coronation is better than your pitch now the big time pressure on the defense for Japan.
1:25:30,so Tommy continues to get loose OK who am I going to get in a big spot it's a good chance for a guy like Pete Alonso yeah we'll see Mullins.
1:25:45,At the moment in the on deck circle first things first J.T. Real Muto Turner at first not going on this pitch real Muto pops it up behind shortstop it's Kenda and he will catch it.
1:26:0,That's how you have Kyle Tucker available but not 100 percent and not available to play the field. Turner's got to take a shot. Let's see if he goes.
1:26:15,catch and that one is driven out to left center field. First Devin Williams got to keep this a one run game and that's not easy against this hitter swinging a miss for.
1:26:30,Power for Japan here. The power of Schwarzer has made it a one run game a one strike pitch swung on a miss that changeup is so so good. He's got to tell you it's coming and you still won't hit it.
1:26:45,Oh and two. Now that's the triple crown for Japan.
1:27:0,man who blasted a four hundred thirty foot home run earlier in this game and Devin Williams made it look bad. So now Okamoto was also homer tonight for Japan. He takes ball one.
1:27:15,here's the 1 0 take their 2 1 0
1:27:30,Well Tony was warming up now he's just pacing he hasn't pitched in relief since 2016 I think it would just be.
1:27:45,he defeats the Darvish is in trouble we'll see to 0 he would be thrown by now he had been throwing but I didn't.
1:28:0,one to the first baseman Mogamoto pulls out one foul it's two and two fan is three outs away from a World Baseball Classic championship it would be.
1:28:15,their third it would be the second team to run undefeated through a tournament Dominican Republic did it back in 2013 to two is low one thing with garbage though.
1:28:30,usually likes to sit in the back end of the of the dugout he's he's top stepping right now like his film looking about what's going on
1:28:45,of this the three to struck it out to down here in the bottom of the eight.
1:29:0,Meanwhile. Tetsuto Yamada. Wanna know from Williams.
1:29:15,I can't tell what it's doing.
1:29:30,makes William so effective is that he's six. The hitter is respecting the change of so much and that change of speed just makes the fastball look so much faster.
1:29:45,the one out Williams throws a strike. That's why you see those takes even hitters counts because he can throw that change up whatever he wants more than not a regular outing. I would say.
1:30:0,one right here a lot of change of counts for him. Oh well he's he's stick with a heater. Here's his 2 1. He does throw the fastball perfectly located to it too.
1:30:15,He's just sitting on. Kevin Williams with the two to and Yamada takes a ball to change up off the inside.
1:30:30,run lead pitch action pitch needs to be a straight the 3 2
1:30:45,that's going down to J.P. One thing to remember Dave with the history here. Hideki Kuriyama the manager of Team Japan was.
1:31:0,Otani's first manager with the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters and it was Kuriyama who encouraged Otani to be a two way player. This would be the ultimate moment. A lot of trust between those two players.
1:31:15,and manager another three to here it is that is ball for Yamada draws the walk the eighth walk of the night for Japan I mean in a way.
1:31:30,Team USA has gotten away with that. That's a lot of walks. A lot of walks. It just tells you the stuff that USA has in the bullpen. Right.
1:31:45,seven eight nine hitters and has a hit and a walk the great defensive shortstop last time Yamada was bored he immediately stole a bag he runs no he started and stopped.
1:32:0,Again that takes a strike he must have either. See if we get the real deal here he runs pitch taken low the throw.
1:32:15,Team USA checking the little things and even sliding base hit away from an enormous extra run with Team USA down to two.
1:32:30,to their final three outs two down in the eighth here's the one one can swing over top the change up.
1:32:45,"please, subscribe to my channel, thank you"
1:33:0,That is in the dirty for another change a block there by J.T. Staying real soft with it.
1:33:15,A lot of times you get really hard coming down on the block the two to the action pitch right here kind of get a swing runner at second with two down here is the first pitch of the night.
1:33:30,with the two to get on the ground the third Arnado pass it throws the first and just in time to get Tony doing something he hasn't done in a long time.
1:33:45,is ripped foul. There was no taking.
1:34:0,fastball hundred and one miles
1:34:15,to hit a ball five hundred feet and throw 100 miles an hour. Nobody like him. McNeill takes a little bit high ball to.
1:34:30,by himself another fastball count I would think jumps up on the bat to one.
1:34:45,David Cavanaugh slam to his right back pay close to last learning he's once and for all going to try but was kept in high. And he just really kept going on at first. Watch. Terry Dabbledorff tofu in nowhere. Exhalation by Morgan. He had actually both players sent elsewhere. To the 큰 duality at the start of the first one. Today the Phallos at his best He'll have it for a hybrid pitch if he can take an offside pitch.
1:35:0,got around that fastball kind of cut right at the last second 98 miles an hour just pure i would think if you're mcnear you gotta stay hard with him
1:35:15,you don't have a chance for it's hard and adjust count down three and two here's the pitch.
1:35:30,McNeil pulls it foul. Well he did adjust Gutsy for O'Halley. And yet the pitching has been brilliant to three to two here in the ninth inning. There has been.
1:35:45,Another 3 2 pitch from Ohtani McNeil takes Bobby Witt to pitch.
1:36:0,pinch run at first base. What it's about it tonight. Bobby Witt can steal a bag whenever he wants. They need a bag here. Bobby Witt's the guy. With the hip. Mookie Betts and then.
1:36:15,and travel one run game night then it takes a strike right on the outside corner.
1:36:30,"Muki, on the ground to second, we'll see if they can turn two. That's one, that's two, it's a double play, and Japan is one. With their leader, their captain, Manu Imano right here, U.S."
1:36:45,against the best Tony to trout
1:37:0,What. Would. A hundred. Miles an hour. Is this funner what.
1:37:15,and hoping to celebrate U.S.A. Looking for heroics. Oh Tony's 1 1 trial takes.
1:37:30,Off the outside is unbelievable. Two and one. Here's the pitch. Trout swings and misses.
1:37:45,the US Arthur Chanbeau USA down to its final strike in the ninth inning pitch to to
1:38:0,Mike Trout here's the pitch in the dirt and 1 0 2 baseball wins tonight a matchup we've all been.
1:38:15,wanted to see three and two from Otani.
1:38:30,He throws trout strikes out swing nine hits they out hit Japan nine to have a lot to be seen was on display this week.
