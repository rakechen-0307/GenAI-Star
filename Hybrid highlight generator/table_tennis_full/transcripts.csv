start,transcript
0:0:0,and this right now is the time where every table tennis fan in the world wants to see what will happen between the man on top right there ma long the dragon the dictator the captain he's world-ranked number one he's the Olympic
0:0:15,He's the standing world champion from Suzhou in 2015 and the only player that seems like a serious contender and he's beaten Ma Long once on the world tour and despite having beaten him three times in the tournament
0:0:30,"the same Chinese Super League season going 3-0 when the pressure is there, there seems to be a mental block or hurdle that is keeping Fan Zhendong from becoming world number one and this will be a real test for the 20 year old."
0:0:45,"to see if he can overpower and outsmart, more importantly, Ma Long here to become the world champion at 20 years old. There's the cup they'll be playing for, the world champions, we'll see."
0:1:0,"Fan Zhendong on his side of the draw started off beating Paragurel of Sweden 4-0 One of the best servers in the game, very difficult to play but Fan Zhendong steady in that An average of a little less than 5 points per game it appears"
0:1:15,"of the day. of the day. This is the first time we've seen This is the first time we've seen a defender of Russia a defender of Russia 4-1. 4-1. Again, for a defender to take Again, for a defender to take two games off of Fan Zhendong. two games off of Fan Zhendong. Really impressive."
0:1:30,"And the amount of championship titles, you can see the results here. Look how many championship titles we have. 2008, 9, 11, 15, and 16. So we're keeping track. I know Ma Long is chasing Vladimir Samsonov."
0:1:45,for world tour titles but as world champion this is just dominant performance out here and again it's been a question of time world rank number two Fan Zhendong with explosive power on both sides he's got the touch he showed us that roller under the net clamp against
0:2:0,"of the year last year. So with all these qualities, like Jonathan Grote said in his Ask a Pro Anything interview, the mental game is what really sets apart a professional and a champion. Lots of people in the world can loop the ball."
0:2:15,"ball powerfully from both sides and have touch. What are your thoughts Gavin? Yeah, that's exactly it. You get to the world number 1, 2, 3, 4. It really is a mental game. Possibly on the world tour."
0:2:30,
0:2:45,to thoroughly deserve for both players here on screen to be here in this final. Yeah we always feel I feel like about a year ago we look head to head between these two and Fan Zhendong has only won once on the world tour.
0:3:0,"against Ma Long. It was in the China Open in 2016. It was a 4-0 victory, but Ma Long has won every other encounter. He's 10-1 against Fan Zhendong, although we do have to look at the most recent matches."
0:3:15,"to really understand the relevance of these statistics. Not to mention at 28 years old, Ma Long might be at his peak, but he's definitely at the peak. He's not still we would think he's not still on his way up. He could continue."
0:3:30,"in the northwest. The league is still in the early stages of development, but the players are still improving. He seems to be maintaining his level, but there's not much other place to go than down from here. By the time he's 30, if he's still able to keep up this performance, Fan Zhendong's going to be 22 years old and still on the incline on his way up."
0:3:45,"at the back of the table. Again, players still feeling each other out. They were actually warming each other up in the practice hall, interestingly enough."
0:4:0,"We talk a lot about mental focus. In the practice hall just earlier, there was a member of the staff who had a medical emergency that was quite scary. I noticed Fang Zhendong, everyone was looking at him."
0:4:15,"was watching in concern, but Fan Zhendong was very focused and made sure that he kept his head in the match for practice here. That could be very distracting and there's no question it got in the heads of pretty much everyone there, you know, human beings feeling for one another."
0:4:30,Not a point dropped yet from the focused Xiaopang Fangjiandong.
0:4:45,sweet spot and how big it is on the backhand side that ball's a wide to the backhand shot and he's moving to get to it but still able to counter and generate a lot of pace it's always like he's making his shot while moving the setup for the next so fast
0:5:0,"First point for Ma Long so far. And by the way, as we get started on this match, if you have any questions for the commentators, you can send them into the social media."
0:5:15,at ITTF World on all social media. Hashtag ask the commentator. Gavin and I will be happy to take those questions.
0:5:30,and that's interesting there. Fan Zhendong opting in this early exchange to go with the little reverse serve. It's a very similar action to the Jang Jeeka reverse serve. But they are quite signature in that.
0:5:45,"I feel like because we've seen Fan Zhendong playing later into most tournaments than we've seen Zhang Jike recently, he's almost sort of taking ownership over that serve, the reverse pendulum."
0:6:0,"And I have to take it back to that meal in Kuwait a few years ago, 2015, with Ma Long and Fan Zhendong. And one thing Ma Long said is, he said, I wish I was fatter, which he said with affection, like Fan Zhendong, so I could hit with ease."
0:6:15,more
0:6:30,full of Nutella and bacon which you wouldn't expect an athlete maybe in the past to be eating but he was loading up on animal fats and a lot of stuff to make sure he had an unusual amount of energy.
0:6:45,"Short side of the table, beautiful shot from Ma Long. We're seeing some slow sort of development on Ma Long's side of the table, Gavin. What do you think would be responsible other than the quality of Fan Zhendong's shots? Yeah, just misfiring a little bit."
0:7:0,
0:7:15,There's the St. Bride vase that they'll be playing for since 1929 in London to honor Fred Perry winning the title.
0:7:30,"1929 a lot of people don't think of fred terry of fred perry for his table tennis, but tennis and table tennis A bit like you gavin I think it'll be a while since we you know until we see that repeat"
0:7:45,Someone winning a major in both tennis and table tennis. I know Monfils is quite a recreational player.
0:8:0,"Oh, burns him on the short side of the table. When you have a set plan like that, it can be dangerous to turn the corner too early. What was really good about that as well, Fan Zhendong going against that side."
0:8:15,"A lot of the time you would find that left hand fast side spin the ball would ping back into the corner where Ma Long had ran around. It's much like we were talking about in doubles, using the sidespin to set up the placement for the third ball, so bravo to Fan Zhendong."
0:8:30,"A little bit off the top of the net, but power for power, the backhands just explode one after another. Landmines going off at the corners of the table."
0:8:45,"But that was better there, Ma Long just settling things down a little bit round the net. That's where he can sometimes be in the ascendancy."
0:9:0,"He's made a comeback by quite a bit, he still has a ways to go. Fan Zhendong again, much like as far as the mental game"
0:9:15,"just like the other players against Ma Long who are strong underdogs where Fan Zhendong is not, it's important that he gets in early to keep Ma Long playing nervous and keep a bit of confidence on his side of the table"
0:9:30,"So quick with that backhand, just a bullet back down the line. A parallel shot anyway. Now five game points for Fang Zhendong to take the first with authority."
0:9:45,Look at the quads on Fan Zhendong. The little wishbone above the kneecap.
0:10:0,Yes. Yes. Yes.
0:10:15,you have to think of another way to win points that will be either little short exchanges around the net or little subtle changes in direction throughout the rallies. So one game point saved the serves are on the side of Fan Zhendong
0:10:30,"Fighting video of a match between Bun-Bo and Tsutomu The winner is a women, T.A. Please enjoy"
0:10:45,best support options. Well-placed push deep on the table. Can be so good if the surprise
0:11:0,"Right, well placed in the middle there by Ma Long."
0:11:15,"Oh, man, to get those back. What an effort from Ma Long and what determination and focus from Fang Zhendong to finish that point. This is going to be in the highlights for sure. Look at this one."
0:11:30,I felt like the patience of Fang Zhendong was so impressive to keep Ma Long from getting the first attack. Very confident play from the 20-year-old and Fang Zhendong 11-7 over the standing world champion and Olympic gold medalist in game one.
0:11:45,Game 1 will be back for Game 2 right after this.
0:12:0,Aquarius reasonably manages to remain in the lead for a time.
0:12:15,"at the stadium, which was constantly involved in some dancing concerts."
0:12:30,"As the drums were beaten, Ma Long was beaten in game one as well. Now we saw a chance, I'd say we got a chance to look at the rackets and the equipment."
0:12:45,"Long's racket and Fan Zhendong's racket, it appeared that the sponge on Fan Zhendong's forehand was a bit thicker than Ma Long's. What were your thoughts on that, Gavin, with the table tennis legends and whatnot? Yeah, obviously with the thicker sponge."
0:13:0,that
0:13:15,the Swedish legends of Jan-Ovi Valdner and Jörgen Persson. They always opted to use the 1.9 sponge which was notably thinner than other players. So giving them a little bit more touch.
0:13:30,"Excellent shot playing the high risk. That is a very interesting thing to pay attention to. I mean, Waldner often thought of as the greatest touch of all time. And then what you're willing to sacrifice, people always ask, what would you recommend? I'm just getting started or who knows, but."
0:13:45,"Yeah, different preferences for different players of course. Fan Zhendong, the cannon on both sides and the touch. Almost, if that one comes back around the net. We got another shot of the year."
0:14:0,"potential here. The angle, look how far he has to go to get that. There was one point with Zhang Jike where he was going the opposite way and slid back to recover a net ball. It was so amazing."
0:14:15,the Packers face the
0:14:30,he was really misfiring in that first set but he still has the confidence to try these shots just because they were missing in the first set you've got to keep going
0:14:45,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:15:0,"The match became important, Zhang Jike would always steal the title, and it seemed like a confidence reducer, something that just, Ma Long needed confidence, and in 2015 he found that, and hasn't been stopped since, hasn't slowed down."
0:15:15,"but it seems like Fan Zhendong is finding some real confidence That's world class play from Fan Zhendong but I feel there, the last couple of points they've been really good points for Ma Long as well the backhand-backhand exchange in the second last point he changed the pace"
0:15:30,"He's not going to compete fast fast fast against fan zing dong and then that second point there He went to the middle, so he's thinking really clearly too, and I think it was the men's World Cup final I'll look it up, but that had a very similar"
0:15:45,"or backhand to backhand exchange with Ma Long changing pace. Match point, it was at 10-9 in game 7, after Ma Long was up 10-6, Fan Zhendong scored 3 in a row, and that confidence on the backhand side."
0:16:0,"Sometimes not hitting it hard shows your confidence, that you're willing to change the pace and deal with the heat and give it right back to the opponent."
0:16:15,"the backhand off the bounce, allowing Fan Zhendong to open first. Very bold play. And there was really bold play round the net there as well. He was doing a little bit more on the receive. He wasn't just touching short with less spin so that Fan Zhendong could spin."
0:16:30,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:16:45,"Just incredible points to recover that ball from wide to the forehand to get back into the backhand blocking and fishing game. And again, Fang Zhendong is going to try to keep Ma Long pinned in the backhand and only go to the forehand in this situation when he can."
0:17:0,
0:17:15,This is a good shot now. This is a good shot now. The lobbing the ball back on the The lobbing the ball back on the table for six or seven is just table for six or seven is just not enough. not enough. You can see Ma Long looking to You can see Ma Long looking to change the pace as he reaches change the pace as he reaches the opening.
0:17:30,between Lin Gaoyuan and Xu Xin.
0:17:45,the
0:18:0,could have been could have been the the German Steffi Graf in the tennis a nice little chiseling slice is what I hoped I was going to see there it was all set up here look at this
0:18:15,"If that ball comes down, it's going to be deep into the body on the backhand side. Very difficult and ambitious shot for Ma Long to take. But again, with that confidence comes some fearlessness and he will take risks."
0:18:30,"Big point to break the momentum. I remember 5-2 on the scoreboard, and suddenly it was a one point game. Now I brought up the past, talking about the chances of these two."
0:18:45,"to be playing in the final. And you get a lot of different opinions about who it's going to be. And it feels like Ma Long still has the upper hand just based on mental maturity and experience under pressure. Looking at the results, again, 10-1."
0:19:0,head-to-head is quite a statement because Fan Zhendong has been world number two for some time now and and the way that the world rank him
0:19:15,
0:19:30,"I think it'll take a while, even if Fan Zhendong wins, before he takes over the number one world ranking."
0:19:45,"Great start to this final though. Both players playing some of their best table tennis. And this is where you want to be doing that. Not out in the practice hall, right here."
0:20:0,a
0:20:15,"with top and side spin and relatively shallow on the table. Ma Long, look at this, about a foot and a half, maybe two feet inside the line, and Ma Long reaches forward, keeps the racket closed. You talked about that tacky top sheet on the Chinese."
0:20:30,"National Team rubber, very closed racket, very important for Ma Long. Short side of the table and the risk pays off. Ma Long with four game points to tie it up. This could be a seven game extra."
0:20:45,he's definitely turning things around he's not won many points when it's been fast diagonal exchanges so he's had to use that brain of his playing to the middle playing some shots down the wing
0:21:0,of wins. Nice change of pace soft with the base back in and mull Light comes back with the speed after baiting Ponneggett going in to the first Rocket back in eleven to six.
0:21:15,"for the Dictator, the Dragon, Ma Long, and we'll be back for Game 3 right after this."
0:21:30,This video is a derivative work of the Touhou Project. It has no relation to the original work.
0:21:45,A game in mortal combat that relies on the two players and the proposal of a game character Each of you votes your response to things like this english xbox widely chinesa playstation tv couch 
0:22:0,isedfdbaoefdgola I'm Frosty Hahaha haha hahaha ahahaha I'm Frosty I'm Frosty
0:22:15,"A player in the top flight falls from the around The player was surprised, hesitated, and tried to save him"
0:22:30,back for game three ma long in red at the bottom of the screen ties it up again the change of pace a real success for ma long
0:22:45,"Now, again, we got to have some conversation and break. We were talking about world rankings and the new system. Looking at the points between them, it's actually much closer than I realized. Fan Zhendong might be able to come out world number one if he wins this match."
0:23:0,"The rivalry is interesting because the camaraderie of being on the same national team, practice partners and close friends, maybe even mentors."
0:23:15,"on some level. When you're out here, it's all business, and the fight is actually a sign of respect, giving your all. Using the length of the table for all that power and speed."
0:23:30,"You can see how much Ma Long has to think out there. In his other matches he can just play fairly standard, but here he's mixing the serves, he's mixing the placements as often as he can."
0:23:45,"Netball there too wide, a bit of sidespin on it, hooking out to the forehand side. So with the new ranking system, I have a chance to see what the world rankings would be in March."
0:24:0,"still be world number one over Fan Zhendong. But Zhang Jike would actually be number five in the world. And Wang Chunting would be number four. For those of you curious about the new world ranking system at Basic,"
0:24:15,"the tournament. It means that how far you get in a tournament determines how many points you get, rather than who the opponent is that you beat. So if you beat Ma Long in the round of 64, for example, it's worth no more than if you beat the 64th seed."
0:24:30,It will encourage more participation so that you have a chance hopefully to see your favorite players the big four from China and all others at the top of the world on the world tour pretty consistently.
0:24:45,"Wow, too fast, so deep on the table when he keeps it that close to the baseline. Sometimes you question yourself to even know if it made it. You can hear that little tick before it hit the shirt, maybe a little bit off the top."
0:25:0,..and those of you back home thinking oh winner speed 75 kilometers an hour that doesn't appear very fast
0:25:15,you think about it sport like tennis 20 meters between you and your opponent in table tennis you've only got four or five meters between the two of you
0:25:30,"This would be equivalent to someone like Roger Federer trying to serve and you're actually on the same side of the court as him trying to return that service. I mean, lightning quick reactions you need for table tennis."
0:25:45,"Indeed the reaction time. It actually comes down to equipment, not comes down to, but includes the equipment that you use that's built for this type of speed. The angle there that Fang Zhendong created with the backhand, you mentioned before."
0:26:0,how difficult it is for the wrist to go that way the natural inclination would be played down the line I think it was in doubles you talked about this the fondant don't pulling some magic out there from over the table
0:26:15,crown boy So well-timed at that rocket backhand. Ma Long really seems to be setting up some plays.
0:26:30,and getting the shots he wants right into the wheelhouse to win the points.
0:26:45,three minutes in the first half of the second half. And it is three edge.
0:27:0,
0:27:15,Thank you very much for watching.
0:27:30,"Wow, the power doesn't faze Ma Long, and right after you talk about the elbow, we see when we would use that raised elbow, when you're in near the table and need to generate all the spin. Look at the Ma Long fan club there with the Ma Long hats. Tiaras."
0:27:45,"of the day. of the day. We've got a couple of We've got a couple of players, players, maybe. maybe. We've got some interesting We've got some interesting questions coming in here. questions coming in here. We'll try to take them on We'll try to take them on towel break."
0:28:0,"This question I'm going to send to you because you're an equipment maker yourself, Gavin. The question is from Jakob Pfeiffer."
0:28:15,does one of the players use a carbon sponge now generally carbon of course applying to the blade I know Ma Long has his own blade and Fan Zhendong is playing with the Stiga do you know the specifics and ingredients if they have carbon in their blades
0:28:30,"Yeah, I mean obviously the the carbon results in a much faster surface Sometimes with with this carbon that's a little bit faster. You have a soft carbon as well So that can always give you a little bit more"
0:28:45,"and catch the ball that way. Vince says it's a unique technique, because it stillYYY could be a possibility for players to hook or touch the net. Yeah, it depends how you play the game, it depends on a player's style as to what carbon they would use. Awesome. Good to know. I'll have some more questions for you about different surfaces in a bit."
0:29:0,seven game points for Ma Long trying to scoop it up from under the table but no dice 11 to 3 a dominant performance for Ma Long to take his second game in a row it's a two-to-one lead for the olympic gold
0:29:15,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:29:30,L'OM fait du boulot à la foule L'OM fait du boulot à la foule L'OM fait du boulot à la foule
0:29:45,"Un joueur et des homeless interviennent, ils nous travent dans leur ranch Ici, samedi 11 mars, la journée s'est mise en cours"
0:30:0,汪倫加油 加油 汪倫
0:30:15,"and a fan making a very cool sign I believe it was from the last time that Ma Long won the major title jumped up on the table, pointed out to the audience that was 2015 in Suzhou when Ma Long"
0:30:30,took the world championship so we were talking a little bit about the surface and the material the blades from hinoki to all wood and you were telling me a little bit about that Gavin yeah
0:30:45,on
0:31:0,"played by the players looking to flick out and dominate. It's important as well that you can put an emphasis on being able to feel the ball and, you know, the depth touch around the net."
0:31:15,"I think this next question that comes in is quite a good one for that point. The Weemo asks, do you think the Chinese players relax and explode, relax and explode before every shot to maintain powerful shots?"
0:31:30,"You know Gavin, I'll let you take this one as the the color in the expert here. Yeah, I mean obviously these guys The look what's really important in the duration of a longer rally is that you breathe? Properly a lot of these guys are actually exhaling"
0:31:45,"As they hit you know, otherwise you get halfway through the rally And you don't have any energy left a little bit like runners as well. It's important that you breathe really well, especially if you're in a long Lobbing rally or a look-to-look rally. There's that little bit of"
0:32:0,Exercise 9.
0:32:15,"balance between the two. The most important thing is balance. The most important thing is when you're putting in the most effort. The breath is super important. I think knowing how to balance relaxing and exploding with power is the most efficient way. Much like a hybrid vehicle, it knows when to use the gas and"
0:32:30,to take care of their bodies for maximum performance this could be an hour 15 minute match although the speed of some of the points the rally lengths I think they're getting into it pretty quickly there's not
0:32:45,"quite as much touch play over the table and they're not, I guess they're both being stubborn to not back off the table, trying to stay in and stay aggressive. So the points are ending a little quicker than usual."
0:33:0,what is Spono's and Dong gets in with t out with the Chiquita Oh
0:33:15,"so that he doesn't get out of position at all and can quickly just flex his body back up and recover. Well Gavin, you had the experience of playing T-Mobile and you were saying how it's a whole different level out here. Are you excited?"
0:33:30,"Chiefs don't attend. So is Saint-Michel not in Las Vegas hardly being visited to challenge this sport? It is really world-class stuff and there is only so much you can see from a computer screen or a TV as well until you actually play these guys, it is really overwhelming. It is literally crazy, and sometimes you don't realize there might be even some symbolism behind it."
0:33:45,really tough when you're out there on table one having to compete against one of these sensational players and that was heinz the hornman in full effect for the around the net shot that fang zhendong just hit that was chop blocked back by ma long to win the point
0:34:0,"Again, for those of you at home, the chop block is a last resort from the backhand that has some Backspin and some a lot of sidespin on it and it's tough to tell how much there is a glitch Smart play the ball was left out in front of my long"
0:34:15,"and he uses a lot of wrist and a lot of spin to make a secure shot instead of going for a clear winner. Well Gavin, when they showed Fan Zhendong's hand before the serve, it looked like it was shaking. That's just the adrenaline kicking in. Massive amounts of adrenaline."
0:34:30,Go into all sports really to get yourself fired up and to be able to play at this really really high level
0:34:45,"And again, for those of you at home who are a little bit newer to table tennis, the wiping of the hand on the table is to wipe the sweat off and make sure they have full grip."
0:35:0,"from the long end to the middle and deep to the back end but it goes long off the neck. How big of a fact do you think nerves are playing right now Gavin? Yeah, I mean obviously scoreboard pressure. I think fans in Dong will be slightly more anxious."
0:35:15,a little bit nervous now
0:35:30,"I don't know about you, but after that exchange, which was quite impressive, Ma Long had a little bit more time here and it seemed like he really just tried to do a bit too much and hit it harder than he needed to. Which is tough to say because even 80% for Ma Long is so fast."
0:35:45,"And a timeout. Remember, neither player has a coach in their corner as they are both from the same national association. Yesterday I had a chance to see Lu Guoliang in the practice hall with Fan Zhendong who was lying down near the end of the game."
0:36:0,"the table for a bit, maybe visualizing and just relaxing before his match. These two practicing together this morning and also Wang Hao, I saw coaching Fang Zhendong as he was practicing with Zhou Yu earlier on in the tournament."
0:36:15,"A little fun fact about Fan Zhendong, he won the men's world cup last year Ma Long not participating So in that tournament By winning that it means Fan Zhendong if he wins this will only need to win the olympics"
0:36:30,"to become a Grand Slam champion alongside Ma Wong, Ko Linghui, Liu Guoliang, Waldner and Zhang Jike, of course. I was like, who's the one I'm leaving out? The guy who got knocked out by Li Songsu earlier, the legend that half of the fans"
0:36:45,"the fans were here for in the first few days. Yeah, Jang Jika over the last few years, he was the big timer when it got to the big events. Interestingly, sometimes Jang Jika not winning too many of the world tour events, but when it got to the really..."
0:37:0,"Nitty-gritty the big big events. He did step up in style didn't he? Absolutely So this is pressure on both sides again a three-to-one lead, you know"
0:37:15,so we saw with the women's singles final with Zhu Yuling and Ding Ning it could have gone to Zhu Yuling being 3-1 up and Ding Ning tying it up was crucial to sort of the momentum in that match
0:37:30,"Pivotal moment of the match now for Fan Zhendong. He needs to keep the heat on, he needs to be hitting the ball fast, get the power on the ball. It's Ma Long that needs to change placements, change spins, change directions."
0:37:45,the game. Excellent back and changing directions. We have just seen not enough...
0:38:0,"Another opponent and you hear Another opponent and you hear the H PHPNカ Japanese H PHPNカ Japanese trademark on the H PHPNカ Japanese trademark on the D diagonal is what we are seeing D diagonal is what we are seeing D diagonal is what we are seeing most of the time. most of the time. Look at that lovely Look at that lovely change. change. Out of the timeout, Out of the timeout, we talk about the Malong... Malong... we talk about the first point out of the first point out of the timeout is a morale boost. timeout is a morale boost. timeout is a morale boost. Up against the Upagainst the Hiroshige Oko. Hiroshige Oko."
0:38:15,And Fan Zhendong stole the point. That can be pretty crushing. He's got a second serve here to do it. That's an interesting call for the timeout on your opponent's serve. Wow! So we're seeing...
0:38:30,"of his own medicine with these softer shots. For me, this is a real sign of confidence and mental maturity in the 20-year-old Fan Zhendong. Fan Zhendong, he's improved over the last couple of sets. He's started to get used to Mahler."
0:38:45,longs tactic of slowing it down playing slower arcing backhand topspins so yeah a lot of resilience shown but really by both men yeah and it's something you know is Tom Zendong might have more power
0:39:0,"If you're all power, it's the versatility and the adaptability, I'd say the improvisation, the improvisation that Ma Long brings to the game that makes him so tough. And look at this, Bateson outcovers the middle of the table with a quick forehand short."
0:39:15,
0:39:30,quickly or else Ponginton will reach it again on the wide forehand. I love that let receive back into your own side of the table.
0:39:45,A little bit of swag from Fang Zhendong shows some confidence and probably relaxes him a bit too. Big point to hang on to the two-point lead again once you've
0:40:0,exactly on the same day.
0:40:15,only there introduced a lot of power and it was successful
0:40:30,to the forehand.
0:40:45,
0:41:0,"cool oh beautiful inside out, step around forehand attack from Fan Zhendong"
0:41:15,well he has this shot clearly in his arsenal it's a shot we just haven't seen come up too many times so far this match well that looked spectacular but actually that was just a percentage play a big reloop on the diagonal
0:41:30,right he got a 75 percenter from Ma Long and he could see that it was coming long cross-court so he set up and turned around
0:41:45,"Lightning speed from both sides. Four shots in a row exchanged as fast as anyone can hit them in the world. And again, their timing to stay close to the table for this. If you watch this..."
0:42:0,replayed time and time again and you only watch one player just consider how little time they have between each stroke which is why it's so important that they're able to you have the muscle strength to not only relax but recover and set up again three game plans
0:42:15,"From all along to take a 3-1 lead, Oh, almost comes back! The scooping shot from down below the table. I'd love to see that happen one more time."
0:42:30,
0:42:45,"to take advantage and catch it before it drops. Here it is, the swoopy sidespin from under the table, catches a little bit off the top of the net, still not an easy ball."
0:43:0,"wasn't very high when he hit it. So, two serves if Fan Zhendong can get this point."
0:43:15,"It sounded like there was a little conversation with the umpire. He's trying to look over at the hands of the umpire. Sometimes a service warning. Again, they are quite particular."
0:43:30,in particular at this tournament being the biggest tournament of the year. Strong start to the point but Ma Long was just too good moving wide to the forehand and it's 11-8 for the Dragon.
0:43:45,It's three games to one. This could be the last game of the men's singles event for the World Championships. Stay right here. Game five coming up.

0:44:45,And the wave starts going around the stadium once again for the men's team.
0:45:0,singles final. As we come back for game 5 we've got a question from Lex Anders. Does hashtag Ma Long take the lead because he is preparing his attacks through avoiding the backhand of Fang Zhendong? Hashtag Fang Zhendong. Well he's certainly avoiding
0:45:15,"The game is called the backhand-to-backhand exchanges. If he plays to the backhand corner, he's doing it with less speed and a little bit more spin. Obviously then when he turns and plays his forehands, he's looking to go into the middle and forehand of Fan Zhendong."
0:45:30,"Excellent counter. Pins Ma Long right in the chest with the shot. When I say chest, I feel like it actually has to be to the left shoulder from the start of this for it to be a problem for Ma Long to turn on."
0:45:45,look like you tried to go around the net there to the short side
0:46:0,commentator narrates a specific sports game
0:46:15,sometimes even serving a fast serve and getting into a quicker exchange.
0:46:30,"He played out wide to the forehand of Ma Long, he brought it a good foot closer to the center of the table this time, maybe hoping that Ma Long would overrun it or not get such a full arm stroke, and it would set up the attack stronger for Fan Zhendong to the backhand corner."
0:46:45,commentator narrates a specific sports game  35KG Nadc
0:47:0,Super reload there and if we remember back to the previous game when he stepped around that corner he went safe and went on the diagonal not this time look at that shot
0:47:15,"He really has to fan the racket up and over and come down after the ball to keep it low to the short side. Again, less forgiveness, less margin for error."
0:47:30,shirt you are wearing. Now for you this is going to be a key ingredient as well but the placement has to be so perfect that moment when you both realize you're on TV!
0:47:45,"So for both of these players, neither of them has been pushed to Game 7 so far in this tournament."
0:48:0,"And I do think that as one statement about how strong their games are, even against their compatriots, they just haven't been tested the way that they have the chance to test each other out here right now. And Fan Zhendong really looking to take this game, you can see."
0:48:15,"Five points to one That he's gonna have to stay focused, but the way he's focused right now. This could go the distance"
0:48:30,"on the road to the final, Ma Long has lost more games than Fan Zhendong."
0:48:45,Rainer von Zendong. Five games have been lost by Ma Long. Only four have been dropped by von Zendong by I think you know I think that's a good thing for my long he he was pushed a little bit more in the run up to this final
0:49:0,"Wow! Oh, it doesn't come down so close. I thought it was overturning to you, Gavin. I've seen moments like that before when I've played a Commonwealth Games and one of my teammates..."
0:49:15,Stuart Crawford he went up with the early shout of yes that's the end of the point it certainly wasn't and the ball came down onto the table not this time though pretty close to the net if that comes down you can bet the ball's going over the cameraman's heads
0:49:30,"Here's an interesting one, we've got a question from AtTableTennisDaily, does Ma Long have any weakness? Here's an interesting one, we've got a question from AtTableTennisDaily, does Ma Long have "
0:49:45,I would say his weakness at the moment but only at this absolute elite level he's lacking that little bit of power in the the muscling muscling exchanges with fans and dong struggling a little bit when it's just racket to racket on the
0:50:0,And now the Diagonal...
0:50:15,I've seen him get tight a few times and this is of course he is human being as much as Timo Boll might say he's a machine and we all joke that he's from another planet. He's clearly human he's just working so hard to be at the very top of what one
0:50:30,
0:50:45,But right now he's being challenged at backhand down the line first from Fang Zhendong again. It's slowed down Look at the speed of the ball just like a trace of light And that's it as soon as there's speed and pace on the rally. That's when you feel
0:51:0,that fans and don't maybe has a 60% chance of winning the rally.
0:51:15,You can see the perspiration there. It is warm down there.
0:51:30,It was very important for Fan Zhendong to play that ball so wide. You see Ma Long had to really reach and he tried to play it back cross court. Whereas he otherwise might have tried to go down the line on this. I think maybe he was even thinking he would fool Fan Zhendong.
0:51:45,"who would break over to cover the forehand, otherwise the obvious choice would have been to play the line. And that's at this level, you often see someone do the opposite of the obvious choice. Still a four point lead at the second towel break."
0:52:0,Each player going for the towel ? Well footwork definitely not a problem. The change of pace in Fang Zhendong left with no room.
0:52:15,the ball that he doesn't go for the rip tries to play a little soft and you really have to worry about your placement because if you leave it on the table slowly and Malone gets a forehand on it it's a lot of pressure to keep the ball right down the line here
0:52:30,"A player calls him or her, and cuts off the leg of his opponent."
0:52:45,"So Gavin, we're two points away from Fan Zhendong sending this into the sixth with some momentum, some confidence and putting some real pressure on the dictator. It's getting really interesting now. Fan Zhendong there just improving a little bit."
0:53:0,a little bit on the service delivery keeping it just a little bit lower to the net.
0:53:15,"It doesn't matter how good someone's backhand is, if you're going forehand into someone's backhand that should be enough."
0:53:30,Game 6 is coming up right after this.
0:53:45,Strёm fra Republiční konstanci
0:54:0,Young players do not incorrectly pronounce the tongue Young players crosses 2 tongues Wrap
0:54:15,"Gameplay is calm, but that is not always the case Nah, I'm just being opportunistic"
0:54:30,Game 6 Players back to the table for game 6 and we start to talk and think.
0:54:45,"about what it means depending on who wins for the future of the sport and who's going to be on top. Gavin, you were saying? Yeah, I mean for for Fan Zhendong, he was to win this. You would fancy then the next five or six years that he could really dominate the sport and"
0:55:0,"to be played in such a strong era, it is tough to be able to do that, but a guy so young to step in, take a world championship title, you would feel that he would then have the confidence to build on that. From Ma Long's perspective, if you're a professional player, you're able to make that jump."
0:55:15,"If he was to win that, he would fancy then, you know, with that points accumulation, he could stay on and be world number one for at least another year. Yeah, we really have to wonder, when is he going to slow down?"
0:55:30,you know for a while in my opinion i thought by now fang zhendong would have been world number one i've been really impressed with ma long to be able to stay on top of his game you know we've seen at 28 years old when fang zhendong or rather zhang jike
0:55:45,"with injuries and other things through the 28, was just dealing with a lot of physical difficulties. And the way Ma Long plays, that's his greatest concern. He's said it in interviews, injury, and he manages to avoid it by staying really healthy and working hard."
0:56:0,amente It's important to be able to mix them up. It's important to be able to mix them up. Using that element of Using that element of doubt.
0:56:15,you know talking about if one player wins i remember thinking as soon as fang zhendong beats malong on the world tour it's over like a pinata malong will never beat him again that hasn't been the case the china open it was a 4-0 victory for fang zhendong and malong hasn't lost
0:56:30,"with another one since not on the world tour. See how he got right in near the back of the table. If that one comes down, he's in great position to counter and spin it up."
0:56:45,"Nice little change of serve there from Fan Zhendong. Notice how the last five games he's been serving into the short forehand. Suddenly there, serving a bit more on the diagonal, giving Ma Long a different look."
0:57:0,"The unknown however, is a skill you haven't fully mastered."
0:57:15,"Speaker 3. If this goes to game seven, I think we're going to see a very different Ma Long attitude wise from the start. There's a little bit of defeat in that step, even the way he lets his head hang down for a moment, of course, he's gathering his thoughts."
0:57:30,with the shoulders shrug a little bit he doesn't want to have to fight a seventh he really needs to figure out what it takes to finish it here again he was up 3-1 be a tough way to lose a championship again
0:57:45,"This title could be a contender for the greatest of all time. I mean, he's just collecting. You know, if he wins the next Olympic Games, I think many will consider Ma Long to be the greatest of all time. But that's sort of the battle."
0:58:0,who can grab the big titles in the world championships and one of the biggest right behind the olympic games i think that conversation would have been the same you know if jung jikook had
0:58:15,"This year in Rio or last year many people would have said he's the greatest of all time And now Ma Long has what appears to be a better chance to earn that title Sure, many people feel that he already is fun conversation"
0:58:30,the NBA season.
0:58:45,the parents don't look so intense oh there they forced his hand into that shake working on the forehand stroke the mom really wants him to be a champion so Fan Zhendong up three points here with his second serve
0:59:0,on
0:59:15,"of the match. It was game 4, we saw so many times, and throughout the match, that Ma Long has covered the wide forehand very well."
0:59:30,excellent placement a bit of sidespin as it bends into the body wide on the backhand side for Fang Zhendong as flexible as that upper body is and as strong as the legs are to support Fang Zhendong to do this that shot is asking a lot and this is a very
0:59:45,very similar scoreline now to when Ma Long played Timo Boll. Timo Boll was in the ascendancy in the 6th set and Ma Long came roaring back. So let's see if that happens again.
1:0:0,"Outstanding shot selection for Fan Zhendong, very bold. Ma Long starts to change the pace and instead of rocketing the backhand into the backhand side like Fan Zhendong had done before, he quickly changes it up. Seems to catch Ma Long off guard."
1:0:15,"off guard. It's funny you brought up the Timo Boll match. You're right. I forgot. Timo Boll had a decent chance to go 7 with Ma Long which would have been absolutely insane. Again, the atmosphere for the sold out crowd is electric here."
1:0:30,"Even the way Ma Long gives the ball back, I feel like, is just in line with the way his body language is right now on the court. Feeling a bit deflated, looking for answers."
1:0:45,foreign and if that doesn't win if that's not an answer. I mean you can understand the stress of oh playing for placement deep out down the line
1:1:0,sports psychologists will tell you now okay you may be going to lose this set you're 9-3 down what's important now over the next four or five points is to keep going try and find
1:1:15,you can expect. against Arsenal under he Garcetta. Under Garcetta under Angular. Angular. Angelar. I think it is a very interesting 축 interesting
1:1:30,in the city. You will feel a lot better about yourself losing 11-8 than if you are dumped out 11-3 or 11-4 and you don't really feel how the game is going.
1:1:45,"So remember, Ma Long was up 3-1. The last time he lost from a 3-1 lead was in 2009. And the power is there. Just in case you were curious who that loss was, it was against Xu Shi."
1:2:0,"The comeback king at the Qatar Open. We saw Xu Xin yesterday. The devastating comeback, being down 5-10, saving five match points against the Dark Knight, Lin Gaoyuan. I think the only one more..."
1:2:15,painful than that for the opponent was Jun Mizutani in Kuwait from down 4-10 Shushin eight points in a row
1:2:30,"That was the most insane touch shot I've seen. Look at this ball. Look how slow it is and how much side spin is on it. I mean, the chop block to set it up forces Fan Zhendong into submission for a defensive ball. He barely."
1:2:45,the Chinese players don't have the flair or the touch of the talent you know that's absolute nonsense
1:3:0,
1:3:15,"and it's not that they're not capable of playing touch, they're playing the wisest strategy to win. And that's what it takes. It's a little bit like money ball. You look at what works and you stick to the plan. Yeah, there was no hand of concrete there as he managed to caress around the side."
1:3:30,of
1:3:45,"that was relatively low. Well, that might look like Goma, popular Japanese word. It's actually Goma. Goma alone is the dragon. It's tough when the seats are equally spaced."
1:4:0,"to really lean into that. So let's see if this timeout pays off for Xiaopang. Up nine, six here."
1:4:15,"And it's four game points for Fang Zhendong. By the way, in case you don't speak Mandarin, Xiaopang."
1:4:30,Little chubby little fatty a term of endearment is the nickname for fang zhendong throughout China long now Hoping to use two serves And he gets the first point game point saved the pressure continues
1:4:45,"Good miss, good miss from Fan Zhendong there."
1:5:0,video as Malone turns the corner blasted down the line
1:5:15,"and we are going to a seventh and deciding game. It's the match we all wanted to see and the game we've all been waiting for. Call your friends, grab your snacks and get comfy because Game 7 coming up right after this."
1:5:30,"From the University ofRhubarb, the Commission of Abu Dhabi and its"
1:5:45,15 winners Thanks for watching and have a great Day!
1:6:0,ПОДПИШИТЕСЬ НА КАНАЛ
1:6:15,The players come back to the table you can see where they've been hitting the ball on the table Fang Zhendong mixing it up a bit more in that last game when the score shows it Now Gavin we were talking about basically the fact that Fang Zhendong went for the backhand
1:6:30,second to last shot for the aggressive shot how he felt more comfortable trying it again. Yeah definitely you know four set points all you need is one of those and you know he needed to play positively the muscle memory was there from from the miss.
1:6:45,"before, so yeah all credit to him."
1:7:0,Look at his legs the right. I mean the knee almost touches the ground He pulls that right foot so far back to be able to turn and play the short side
1:7:15,"Once again falling back from the table, it's down the line, it's the short side of the table for Fang Zhendong. Gavin, when is Ma Long going to pick up and start moving out to the forehand to cover and trust his backhand in the rally?"
1:7:30,
1:7:45,"And that's one way to handcuff the opponent, serve it really wide to the backhand. Fang Zhendong is not likely to go for the around the net shot on the opening. Not against Ma Long. You know, the last time a man single-handedly..."
1:8:0,at the World Championships went to seven games was a decade ago in 2007 Zagreb Wang Liqin vs. Ma Lin. Interestingly enough Wang Liqin also came back from 3-1 down.
1:8:15,he's fired up the dragon is breathing fire so even with this massive pressure on both of them the first four points nothing against the serve
1:8:30,for player network. Long push to start it off.
1:8:45,"seeing different intensity out here. Fang Zhendong with his chou lei and his clenched fist looked right in the eyes of Ma Long. Again, great friends off the table, but right now this fight, the gloves are off. Still playing fair. When there's a bit of heat."
1:9:0,and a bit of pressure. Just don't miss your third ball.
1:9:15,credit again to ma long for moving anticipating well to cover the forehand it adds extra pressure for fang zhendong who has a plan he's played it successfully wide out to the forehand many times but seeing ma long waiting there makes you second guess yourself and try to play it even wider
1:9:30,"There is enough pressure on this as it is, it's a good service delivery and a spin on the table. Sometimes you'll find that could be enough!"
1:9:45,"Full stroke and just like you said Gavin. Because it's that added intensity now, the pressure is there. Both players, their hands are a little bit tighter. When a player's hand is tight, you can see it."
1:10:0,"you want to be attacking. And this is part of the reason we were saying earlier, the Chinese players, the top Chinese players, will play boldly near the very end of a close match. And it tends to work out in their favor."
1:10:15,"Let's service, Ma Long with his hand in the air."
1:10:30,Cheese Score! Deceptively heavy underspin
1:10:45,"Now one thing we haven't talked about because it has it hasn't been that relevant in the match so far is the serves of Ma Long They're so deceptive, but they're very subtle. They're not flashy You know Dima has some very iconic signature serves and Ma Long"
1:11:0,"The pendulum serve almost always the most traditional serve in table tennis, but still with the third ball waiting and how difficult and subtle it is. It's just really an intimidating and important job for the receiver to try and read it well."
1:11:15,"and how brave that was. So many players when they put in a big fast service delivery, they then go for a short serve after it. Have the bravery to step in and do the same serve again!"
1:11:30,Softball and spinning from Ma Long to take 6-3 lead. The fist 2 points to Fan Zhendong in this game in a spin back-and-forth ever since Ba Ma Long is starting run into the lead
1:11:45,"Remember, neither player has a timeout left, only one per side."
1:12:0,The Jancyclopedia is focused on the world-class martial arts organizations which bring the best of evening sports.
1:12:15,in that service delivery. The racket of Fan Zhendong was shaking again and hopefully that's going to help him to bridge the gap. These two points that he's trailing at the moment.
1:12:30,"The  provided basket world champion has with him, The provided basket world champion has with him, a hoppocic"
1:12:45,
1:13:0,"All these footwork exercises are for get around there under the serious amount of pressure Explosive big powerful forehand to the right area right? Actually, I misspoke He's played it down the line to the short side even more challenging"
1:13:15,For Hope there is not going down in the stats as an unforced bet of that because that kicked
1:13:30,
1:13:45,"If I'm not mistaken, this is the first ever final in men's singles at a world championships for Fan Zhendong"
1:14:0,"Every point from here on out, Gavin. Just wasn't the racket head acceleration there from Fan Zhendong. And obviously with this Netaku ball, sometimes just going a little bit flatter and a little bit more direct."
1:14:15,"You need to accelerate the wrist to make sure you have that arc on the ball. So a second serve here to capitalize on, and it's crucial for Fan Zhendong with Ma Long's serves coming up."
1:14:30,"Oh, a break off the top of the net. He is so focused right now, I didn't even see him turn to apologize. He just immediately went down to his hand. I think thankful that he was able to take the point. And it looked like there when he was giving the ball back, he gave a little apology."
1:14:45,"Look like Ma Long almost started to clinch his fist for that. Save your nets and edges until 3-0, 7-0. Timeouts earlier, nets and edges later."
1:15:0,the new trend for table tennis. We saw the hands shaking from all along as well. The pressure on both sides as many times as.
1:15:15,"...they've been in a relatively similar situation Everything changes when it's the world championships Also when it's the player who's right behind you trailing and waiting to take your job as the world leader I think in this situation as well, when the hand is..."
1:15:30,Shaking it is easier to get round and play forehands. It's very tough to have that touch and feeling on the ball for your backhand when the hand is definitely wobbling.
1:15:45,"Big point. He takes it away. Gavin, that's a really interesting point you brought up about the forehand and the arm really doing so much that the hand is not quite as relevant as it is on the backhand side."
1:16:0,Is this a changing of the guard at the top of World Table Tennis?
1:16:15,else to look at this shot. How does the body bend like that falms and only just giving it his all to try to get a forehand.
1:16:30,The grunt of Ma Long on that ball and he's rebalanced quickly. His head just went from head height to about below the waist. His body contorted. Screenshots are going to be going up in amazing photos.
1:16:45,"from that, but Fan Zhendong will injure himself and do whatever he has to to take this title. There can't be too many points left, save nothing."
1:17:0,And it goes long. Ma Long leaves it dangling off the forehand side. An uncomfortable ball. Will Ma Long rob this once again? What was the number one rule under pressure after a service?
1:17:15,
1:17:30,Ma Long is waiting there for the fourth ball attack for the counter and it was quite a receive to an uncomfortable place. Nine all in game seven. Ticket holders with the best investment of the year.
1:17:45,Last two serve combination we will see for Ma Long. Whoa! Backhand to backhand the challenge. There was a shout from the crowd.
1:18:0,"in the middle of that. Quite shocked to hear that, especially here. But to recover that ball way wide on the backhand side and keep it in play and deter the inside-out forehand. So Fang Zhendong is pointing."
1:18:15,"I'm really curious what it is. Or I guess just where the ball went. That it went behind the scorekeeper, the assistant umpire's scoreboard. Yeah, but there was a massive shout there. We could even hear that from our commentary position. I don't know if that would be enough."
1:18:30,is really on but obviously both players zoned in adrenaline is high at the moment maybe they didn't even hear it quite possible the focus we've seen from these two uncanny ma long with championship point
1:18:45,The point of the match is against match point. Xiaopang on fire and Ma Long gave everything in the match.
1:19:0,"Still it wasn't enough to take down world number 2 Right off the bat, the backhand 2 turning the corner And finally a shot so wide, mile long, a little bit farther from the table And it costs him 85 coins"
1:19:15,
1:19:30,"Deuce in the 7th, Fan Zhendong with the serve. And it goes loose! Look at the eye contact! That's the biggest celebration I've seen mid-match. Ma Long is ready. He is so ready to do it."
1:19:45,"but it's not over yet, and Fan Zhendong proved that down 9-10. What a release of air and energy. One more match point for the dragon in red."
1:20:0,do you serve short or do you serve fast into the backhand run run blind and hit a forehand it's up to him
1:20:15,commentator narrates a specific sports game
1:20:30,on top of the world three years unstoppable and at 20 years old he holds back Fang Zhendong who will remain number two in the world what's it gonna be? We're gonna have an interview on the court from the man who shot down the world record.
1:20:45,shared his love with the world after winning the Olympic gold medal. He can't believe it. Absolutely tested down to the line here. Both hands in the air this time. And the racket that was tossed is collected along with the title.
1:21:0,What a performance Gavin. He did so well on match point there. He ran round blind off the serve He gave himself lots and lots of space to rip that forehand ballsy really really positive
1:21:15,and look at them now celebrate and this is not the first time we've seen this gesture Ma Long held the flag with Zhang Jike shared the flag of China to hold up as a team after winning the Olympic Games in Rio
1:21:30,"and once again immediately calls over Fan Zhendong, the runner-up, to share this moment with him. A painful moment for Fan Zhendong, but a moment of honor for China and the two best players in the world raising the banner."
1:21:45,commentator narrates a specific sports game
